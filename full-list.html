Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  Terrible from day 1. They asked me to do the house repairs made too much issue to place a washing machine as he didn't want it in balcony. The was not painted or cleaned despite asking multiple times although he did cut the amount for that from previous tenants. They asked me to leave within a month stating that is their house and they can do whatever they want. <br />
They harrassed me with multiple calls and when I finally left in 10 days they told they would give the deposit later and they haven't given it till now and they refuse to do that now<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes I haven't received my deposit still and he says he won't give<br />

Experience of tenants :  House was in exact same condition when left compared to when received. Society manager was disrespectful to spinsters and took maintenance money for the time previous tenants were staying. Harassed us in the middle of the road and took the money just because we are currently staying and the other who owned them money had already left.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  In human owners and non cooperative society. Only looking to take money n do nothing in return. Charged 62 k as bill when we vacated the house requesting to return the paid 50 k advance. Completely inhuman behaviour and made us homeless during this pandemic<br />

She occasionally provides food and had no trouble at all even though I made some noise here and there whenever there was drinking involved. She paid back the full deposit amount which was just 30k that too in a posh locality like Koramangala. She did cut 2k for a chair that I had broken which was fine. <br />

Experience of tenants :  House was filled with cockroaches. They will keep on saying they will send a guy to clean up the place but they never will. Yet, they will charge you for pest control when you're vacating. Maintenance fee is bullshit. I don't see any maintenance service provided. They fucking charged me for a broken door stopper which was already broken when I moved in. They were aware of it because it was broken when they were showing me the house before I move in. Every now and then, they will come up with random reasons and they will charge you random fees on top of your rent.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes, Security deposit not refunded yet. It's been more than two months. They claim that they do not have funds to give the refund amount due to covid. But they didn't stop taking rent during covid. Google Zipro and see the reviews. Worst flat experience of my life.<br />

Address:  Vasanth Nagar<br />
<br />
Experience type:Bad<br />
Experience of tenants :  It was house where 14 girls were starying in a 3bhk apartment run by a lady whose house was above us in an apartment, intially it was fine just 3 girls later I saw the house was not clean, it was pest infested. No food was provided had to use kitchen to cook food, which was unsuitable because cockroaches were a bigger problem. I used to cook rarely because of this reason and later the lady added one more girl in our room to add to our problem. It was difficult to access the bathroom sometimes. She told she has good wifi and tv with all channels, it was all a sham.<br />
During COVID she demanded full amount, I paid more than the rent.<br />
I have finally vacated the place and do not wish to go back and nor anyone should, as my roommates started falling sick because of cockroaches, and one of the girls had allergic reaction on her face.<br />

Experience of tenants :  Stay in house experience was okay, owner used to live in the top floor. Facilites wise there is not much. At the time of leaving, you will be charged mandatory 1 month extra charge apart from painting charges (1 month rent), any other wear or tear damage etc. All in all, he kept our 3 months worth of money from deposit<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  He will cut your deposit due to small small issues here and there. And he always deals in cash so forget about getting any rent receipts for HRA , get ready to rush to ATM by end of the every month. You will not get even half of your deposit back even though you leave the house in perfect condition<br />

Name of pg/hostel/Apartment:  COHO Basapura, hosur road  <br />
Address:  Basapura<br />
<br />
Experience type:Good<br />
Experience of tenants :  Coho is a gurgaon based startup. I joined the property in early days since they started working in Bengaluru. The property is in Basapura, it's a secluded place with nearby market at-least 1 km away. I joined the property as the deposit money is only 2 months and I was low on money to pay for 5 6 month. The rent is 8k for double sharing. The rooms are good but there is a big difference between mock room and actual room. So you should be wary of that. <br />
Housekeeping service - they are average. once in a week in starting and once in two week while in quarantine. They gave the reason that there are less people in property. They promised to change the bed sheet every week but it was mostly once in 3 week.<br />
Wifi - Wifi was pain in the ass. sometimes it was not available, sometimes the speed was too slow to work. They are giving 5GB per day to use. Overall, bad experience.<br />
parking - Ample space for parking. <br />
Electricity - In initial days, the electricity was free. Then they introduced metered charges which is ok. The problem was they had a meter per flat. I had to pay 1.5k to 2k for a single room per month even when there is no AC. Ideally for such flat, the bill should be only 500. The rate is 12rs per unit which is too high.<br />
power backup - it was good/<br />
<br />
One more thing, they asked us to change the building because they wanted to rent one building for families. So they asked us to vacate the house and shift to other building. Now they did it without taking without taking us in confidence. There was no communication that why they need to do it, what is the reason behind it. It was that it's a management decision. Negative outlook for this.<br />
<br />
Garbage collection - Although garbage collection was done by them, but it will be weeks before they take it out. <br />
<br />
Food - it's 3.5k extra for breakfast, dinner and lunch on weekends. But the quality was poor. No taste at all.<br />
<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  IT's stuck, I will update it later<br />

The agreement said two months prior notice and we duly informed him on the first of August 2020 that we will be vacating on September 30th and that he can start looking for tenants. He asked us to find tenants and that he would return one month's rent if we find someone within these two months. So we advertised on Facebook and nobroker, spoke to prospects even. As we were in our hometown, I had left my house key with my house help who used to regularly clean the house. Cut to Sept 6th, we reached Bangalore to vacate and the owner refused to acknowledge that we had informed him earlier and stuck to the excuse of not having the key. Neither had he asked me about the key earlier in the last month,  nor did he mention anything about bringing someone to the house. All this while I had kept my house help lady ready to come in and open the house when needed and also while we ourselves were looking for tenants. So in the end he deducted 4 months of rent from us, that's August, September, October and November (painting charges). <br />
This man is very hard to talk to, arrogant and has hardly any decency. Please watchout.<br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  The Deposit was hogged up and if i need the money back, my sister's photo for shagging off was asked for <br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  YES<br />
 in August where i told the landlord about vacating the apartment on 6th of August .. which is around the time i pay my rent for the previous month.<br />
to which that person brought in his sons and started to impose in various things like:<br />
August will not be counted as the notice period as it is beyond 31 July (No Date mentioned in rental agreement for starting of notice period)<br />
therefore the notice conveniently moved to August , September, october (3 months against the 2 written in rental agreement)<br />
getting the House painted inside out from URBANCLAP only which costed me a bomb . (which was never mentioned in agreement)<br />
Deep cleaning .. (never mentioned)<br />
Wear and tear due to simple house ageing.<br />
All in all, despite being true to my word in fulfilling the agreement. the person who is like the biggest God Guy, hogged on almost all of my deposit.<br />
Anyways, Maintaining my composure and blaming the tough times, i left the house and came back to my hometown with a receipt of whatever meagre amount was left of my deposit:<br />
the person handed over the amount transfer to his sons.<br />
the son did the transfer in small parts, gave 2 parts of the deposit post which they started becoming hostile and said that if you want your money get a lawyer.<br />
at the end of 2 months, they brought in a new bills of things that were NOT broken in my presence and refused to give any money .<br />
ON CONFRONTING THEM ABOUT THE WRONG DOING , THEY STARTED TO ABUSE AND ASKED FOR MY MOTHER/SISTER'S PHOTOGRAPHS FOR THE PURPOSE OF SHAGGING OFF.<br />

<br />
Experience type:Bad<br />
Experience of tenants :  Owner stays at ground floor, where as he rent out 1st floor and 2nd floor. Owner is quite a non negotiating kind of person. Also he would prefer to be least helpful and in case he does something for you as if he is obliging you.<br />
And another thing is you will not feel but your movement will be silently monitored. And most irritating part is 1BHK that he rent out has only 30k worth of almirah in it nothing else still he charges 1.5L of hefty deposit. <br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes, I did not renewed the agreement and vacated the house on the last day of agreement as he never came back with mext year's agreement and terms and conditions. He deducted 10k from depisit on top of 15k for painting charges stating that although I paid for all 11months of contract I should have given him notice on 9th month and blah blah blah. <br />
After vacating the house also he insisted on removing the waste, which he has to do or for what he is taking 15k<br />
He is money minded. <br />

Experience type:Bad<br />
Experience of tenants :  Price - Highly overpriced, 18000 per month not worth considering the service they provide. Owner asks for rent on time but refuses to give back the security on repeated requests, making unjustified excuses.<br />
<br />
Cleanliness - not well maintained. Rats, cockroaches and pests pretty commonly seen. Food not hygienically prepared. I requested the owner to get my room disinfected for many days before I could finally get it disinfected. Even then it was not proper as cockroaches and pests didn't stop.<br />
The caretaker there doesn't do anything until you pay him (even after paying 18000 per month).<br />
<br />
Food - unhygienic preparation, not healthy.<br />
<br />
Beds not proper, cockroaches on bed while you are sleeping.<br />
<br />
Rooms not ventilated properly.<br />
Don't use generator on weekdays during day time, so in case of power failure, you have to manage without electricity.<br />
<br />
Management doesn't help you in any way if you are having any problems. Not returning my security deposit on repeated requests.<br />
<br />
 Had to file an fir in police to get my security deposit back.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  The caretaker wasn't returning my security deposit and after repeated calls, stopped picking up my calls. I filed an FIR and thanks to Bangalore police, I fortunately got my deposit back.<br />

Owner Name: Prashant Gupta<br />
This happened a few years back. January 2016.<br />
I, along with one of my classmates came to Bangalore for internship. Stupid young college boys. We met the owner and we decided to rent a room in his already fully furnished house for 13000, 6500 each and gave 50000 as deposit.<br />
We had told him that we would leave by June and asked him for contract. He didn't give one. We asked if there is any other charge. He said no. He was the "nice" and "sweet" guy. We thought okay. It was our first time in Bangalore so didn't know anything.<br />
Although the room didn't deserve even 10k as it had shared bathroom, didn't had almira built it, no windows or balcony, we were new and desperately needed the place since we visited a few PGs before and didn't like them and our internship started after 3 days. It was barely a room for 1 guy and we shared it thinking at least no hidden charges are there.<br />
When we told him in May that we are leaving in June end and he said that can we put a post for replacement. We did but couldn't find anyone as it was too overpriced ( lucky guys who didnt take it).<br />
At the June end, when we met to discuss to return the deposit, he said he will cut 13000/- as painting charge. I was shocked and we kept on arguing for  more than 1 hour. He didn't budge and we had to leave Bangalore with 37000/- as we didn't have proper agreement or recorded conversation over chat or audio.<br />
Since a lot of big companies have moved to that area, please be cautious of such people.<br />
Please stay hungry but don't stay foolish like us.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  For 6 month of stay, 1 month of painting charge was cut. We didnt get the painted house when we moved in.<br />

Experience of tenants :  Hi Guys, I wanted to share some worst or like leaving in hell experience about house owner, house address - 264/10 House no. 20 1st cross 3rd main, BTM 1st stage, opposite to Sri Someshwara Swamy Temple <br />
I stayed in 1 RK around 14 months When IU vacant the house he said your rent agreement was renewed and I have to stay again 11 months and here i am vacating before 11 month then i have to pay 2 months rent + 1 month rent + painting + maintenance charges.<br />
even he is asking more money, <br />
And when I start staying there he didn't informed me about no friends can stay there even family members. we have to p[ay extra water bill also.<br />
I worst part of the story comes now, I get to know by my friend who used to stage in front of the building.<br />
One family few days vacant the house and they have 4 year old girls.<br />
the owner is asked to pay more money event he deducted the 50K money saying you damaged the this bla bla.<br />
and he locked this 4year kid in black room those guys was innocent so they scared and paid the money when this was happed no one is aware about it, later when they vacated then most of the people get to know.<br />
What the hell is wrong with most of the local people in bangalore.<br />
Note:- I am not saying all the locals are in bangalore are the same , i meet with 2 owners they are to good even they help you if you asked for any help, they help us in legal options also and police help also they provided with there contacts. So not every one but still most of them.<br />
I attached the screen shot of the address as well.<br />
The house deal was done by his husband and son, and the rent agreement was created with the name of M.N. Rekha<br />
They have multiple building. be cautious when you are going to rented this house.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  They didn't refunded any amount<br />

Experience of tenants :  So the owner was very rude from the beginning abd demander whole deposit of 70k and one month rent before even signing the agreement. He also posed a lot of conditions like swiggy and online delivery will not be allowed. Etc. It was a huge red flag and we cancelled the agreement. But we had already paid one month broker fees (we were stupid and naive, i agree) and the broker (Harsha of Mahaveer Enterprises) refused to pay it back. Later, the owner called and badmouthed us and even threatened us. We also gave back. Later came to know that this particular broker has a business with some unscruplous house owners. They take broker fee and the owner takes hefty deposit, and then the owner starts making the tenant's life hell so taht he is forced to vacate soon. And there goes his deposit and broker fee down the drain. This broker almost has a gunda raaj and will never give back money.<br />
It was traumatizing.<br />

Experience of tenants :  The landlord had some rules which he had clearly mentioned before moving in. First no loud noises after 11 p.m. since it was a very residential neighborhood. Second no smoking in the premises. Third no pets in the premises. Both my friend and I were good with it. Deposit he initially asked for 1 lakh and rent as 20K per month. We negotiated deposit to 80K. The rent agreement stipulated a fixed amount to be paid during vacating which was 15K as maintenance and painting. And notice period was one month. That was already way better than our previous place. The landlord never bothered us even though he lived upstairs, unless we were being too loud after 11 pm. Then too he would just send a text message. He helped us out in the beginning with drinking water. He even encouraged us to speak to our neighbours if we wanted more info. The house was big and beautiful but it was quite old. So we faced some electricity issues during lockdown which was really frustrating because of work from home. Today,on 29/10/2020, we vacated the house and he handed over the check with no extra deduction apart from what was specified in the rent agreement. Just waiting for the cheque to cash and he told us to contact him if there were any issues with it because we were moving out of the city. He shared his PAN number, adjusted water bill and had a separate electricity meter for us. All transactions were either digital or via cheque. All electrical repairs that we had to get done was reimbursed to us. It was a great place to stay with minimum hassle and I would definitely check if the place is still available when I go back to Bangalore.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  No.<br />

Property provided by:  Found the house on no broker. It was an independent house and I took the entire flat all by myself.  <br />

<br />
Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  Hello guys, I was waiting to write here.. I just received the deposit and hence I can sharing my amazing experience with you guys...<br />
<br />
Guys if you want to have a roller coaster ride with bouts of silence in between then definitely go for this house. It can give you the tour of Disney adventure in times of Covid. <br />
<br />
The owner and his family will appear to be an angel in the first few months of your stay and you might even feel that you are staying in heaven. The inside of them is nothing more than a devil but tht picture will come in front of you at a much later stage when you would have cursed every person who tells that Bangalore is worst as far as landlords are concerned. You will smirk thinking I got the best of what this city can offer.<br />
<br />
He will say that you will have 24*7 water but mind you if after a bad day you go for a shower and would be enjoying the shower and suddenly you see the water is gone and then you have to call these guys each time and then wait for another 1 hr in the half shower state. Mind you if you are too cool to notice, this person will show his talent by including the amount of water charges in the rent so that whether you are staying or not you will have to pay it. (I payed for the house in covid without using water and please no relaxation in rent) <br />
<br />
Since the house is on the first floor, you will be sandwiched between two families who lacks common sense and decency. They will harass you in every possible way.<br />
<br />
The best part is I used to send rent on every 1st morning, somehow I missed sending the rent on 1st morning in a month and he shamelessly messaged me on the 1st evening saying rent not received, so these beggars don’t believe in agreement and all where the date is to pay rent between 1 to 5 so they are kind of suffering from trust issues that you will run away from the house without paying rent though they stay on the ground floor.<br />
<br />
They will deduct undue charges from the deposit and gettin it back would be a pain in the a** for you.<br />
<br />
He had shamelessly hit the parked bike of my friend with his car and it caused damage of 5 k but I am sorry if you expect him to reimburse that.<br />
<br />
So if you guys want to meet this person who descended straight from heaven then you can touch base with him on the following contact details:<br />
<br />
Owner name is : Jagdish <br />
House no 2426, 16th A Main road,<br />
HAL Stage II, Kodihalli, Bangalore.<br />
<br />
The house is available for rent and you can enjoy the ride.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes he deducted undue charges from the deposit<br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  The owner is purely money minded, won't maintain the house, not A single furnishing provided, no help from him at all. He won't return the deposit and since he was head of police department, member of lokayukt and lawyer, no authority will help. The society management is scared to talk to him. The only thing working out for this flat is the location and space but trust me you can get better anywhere else in btm, the society is rude to bachelor tenants overall.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes, the owner flat-out refused to return anything saying he will need the house repainted and cleaned.We agreed and asked him to cut 20k after discussing painting and cleaning costs with secretary, the owner blocked us then. The society management has been useless and people are afraid of him. Even they won't advice you to take this house on rent. <br />

Reason for choosing the house/PG : The house location is good and we were bachelor girls looking for gated society that's all, the house doesn't even have backup and members don't like bachelor girls ,they have raised questions on us inviting guy friends so now our guy friends were not allowed also the commented on our character if we came late.<br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  The apartment is in ground floor and breeding ground for various types of Insects including snails. The owner, Mr Ranjeet is very much money minded and don't have respect for tenants privacy. He drops by unannounced all the time. Apart from that he did not reimburse a single rupee from my deposit and started ignoring my calls once I left the flat. In addition to that he held my rented furniture with him, which he agreed to allow the pickup for on the very next day of me vacating the flat, and I ended up paying the rental company too. The flat has no power back up and there are more powercuts in the complex. The rent is also on the higher side for an unfurnished flat. <br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes. I did not receive any money. <br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  It was really bad! The landlord used to stay at ground floor with his family. Every day there was new rule to follow! He used to send his son to read our newspaper every morning and never ever paid for their own. After getting a new internet connection from a reputed service provider, he asked us to drop it and instead, was forcing us to take the same and dish connection from the local operator!! When we denied, he tried to threaten us by saying the local cable owner is really rowdy and that won't be a good experience for us!! Things went out of hand when he actually cut our internet wire!! After that we decided to move out of the house! One more thing, anything that we bought while staying at that place - either landlord or his wife used to come and check the price!! Never ever seen a family like them!!<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes! That's the funny part! What calculation he did God knows, out of 1L only 30k was refundable according to him! Not only that - he made us buy a new fan for the living area! It was not working and we were ready to pay the electrician! But he was not ready to accept that. Never ever take that house! Both the husband wives are greedy like hell!<br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :   <br />
1.Totally disappointing stay of 1 yr. Owners have concerns for each n everything. 2.Want working ppl as tenants but don't put common dust bins, want us to either walk 500m-1km to throw garbage or wait for garbage vehicle, which hardly come n if come won't wait for 5 mints. I had undergone a surgery of my fractured ankle twice, fell down in house, not able to run always to throw, garbage from 2nd flr or clean house everyday which was known to owner, they still said I didnt clean house or teach my kids to keep house clean. Is the way someone talk? They keep on changing statements talked in front of their kids, what do they teach them. 3. Want us to put washed clothes on terrace for drying, say if put in house, walls will get moist although washed in washng machine. 4.They have 3mths notice period,real concern starts wen u give notice to vacate. They say although 3mths there to vacate, but want to put ad then n there, want "us" to put on ad portal, on asking, if they get new tenant early, said we need to vacate house. If "we" get new house early, we need to give rent of full 3mths. When I asked pls let us know if u get tenant n if they will occupy before 3mths n pls give us time to find new house, they said "because you said so many things, now stay for 3 months till 1-Jan". 5. After giving notice, forcefully took 1 key, we were 2 members, 1 in day n 1 in night shift, we said we won't be able to manage wid single key, they asked us to take key from them n submit, wanted us to rush everyday from 2nd flr be it neck of time or asked us too make new latch key, but key maker not allowed to come. 6. They are not people of words. For them, it is "heads I win, tails you loose". It was 8Oct we gave notice, as per 3mths time, lady owner said to vacate house 7days before it comes to 1Jan. We said we'll vacate on 28-29Dec being weekend n she agreed to it, we made our itinerary to travel to Mumbai for celebrations in family. Seeing their previous problems of communicatn, I recorded this conversatn for my records. When i sent them d conversatn, they said "I" was confused n totally changed their statement n mind, asked to vacate house on 24th saying it is 7 days before of 1-Jan. As per calendar if we take 1-Jan too it is 25th, we said 24th is working day in night shift we can only vacate on 25-Dec they said either vacate on 24th or pay 7 days extra rent. They ruined our biggest celebrations in family. 7. I have not seen people greedy for money like them. If we vacate d house  wanti to be occupied then n there saying it will be their loss n have so many debts to pay. 8. We were about to vacate on 25-Dec n I had my job change, my salary was on hold we had to manage from single salary of my son, I asked them on 10-Dec to adjust d amount from security deposit, they fought like anything, asked me pay d rent anyhow or vacate d house on the spot. 9.They don't want many ppl in house, want to know everything about visitors in house. 10. want rent n other paymnts in cash only n want us to run to ATMs which are always out of order. Saying they want money on time to pay EMIs, if so why can't we put money in their bank account. 11.Height was, after giving notice to vacate, they will anytime enter d house in your presence or absence nd r not worried if you r sleeping in bedroom or have guest. As per them their wardrobe handle is so delicate to hold hanger wid 1-2 dry shirts or 1 towel, they directly entered bedroom making noise n threw d hanger with clothes, fought when I had guest at home n my son was sleeping after his long week of night shifts. 12.Say we did not clean house same as given, wanted us to call professional ppl to clean wid chemicals. We cleaned d house to max while vacating still cut 1k for cleaning, cut 380 rs for tubelight which did not even last for year.13.Want money on time, but when it was time to give money back they gave excuses like it was eclipse n painting work going on. Stick to things of their benefit in agreement if something is in tenant side, they clearly deny.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes, a lot, they cut big amount<br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  The stay was fine, but owner one day told us to vacate and gave 2 months time which is fine. However deducted a lot of amount ( Around 50k) in the name of rent hike. He never spoke to me regarding this in the 2.5 years but 15 days before leaving he brought up all this. I objected but of no use. Also, he didn't share his PAN card copy for last 6 months (The previous 2 years were fine as he had provided the PAN Number and the organization at that time was accepting it) <br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes, deducted 50k<br />

Experience type:Bad<br />
Experience of tenants :  House and location is good. Owner is sweet initially,  we gave 90k as deposit,  initially he told us he will deduct only the painting cost from the rent. Rent is 24400.00 but actually he took more than that. Last he misbehaved  with us. He charged us unnecessarily, he showed all lame damages those were there from the beginning,  but he denied  and took the money from us. <br />
My parents came to stay for 2 weeks, he took extra 100 rupees per head per day. I told him we went for a tour, they just came and stayed for 3 to 4 days maximum then we all went. Still he took the money. Even the day my parents left at 7am morning, he took the money for that entire day as well. <br />
<br />
He returned back the money in several installments. Even with so much of attitude he showed. <br />
<br />
2 month was the notice period, we gave him exact 2 months notice, still he returned our money back after 3 months we left the flat. And that is also after deducting unnecessary  amount.<br />
It was a pathetic experience. <br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  yes<br />

Address:  B-001 Gaana Regent Apartment Channsadandra Bengaluru Karnataka <br />
<br />
Experience type:Bad<br />
Experience of tenants :  Building amenities was well n good.<br />
No water shortage. Power backup was always there. Parking facility.<br />
In the rent that we got that flat was amazing. everything was good for the price we paid except the security deposit that we paid.<br />
The owner was hesitant to return it. <br />
Still we managed to get back some 20k out of 55k that we gave.<br />
This was the only bad experience i had here. It is a society where family lives mostly so you are not allowed to take your friend of opp. gender inside the society. Owner always behaved well exept the last incident i mentioned.<br />
<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes. The owner was telling that he will have to do whitewashing and painting that would cost 30k and some other maintenance that will cost around 10k.<br />
But anyhow we were able to get 20k atlast.<br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  Very Bad<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Out of a deposit of 2,10,000, owner cut nearly 80 thousand rupees. Since it was a 3 bhk during the course of the stay, 3 tenants left, he took 10 thousand rupees from each of them, apart from that he did not return the deposit for nearly one year to a tenant. He charged money for pest control, balcony painting. There was a one centimetre oil mark, he cut 3000 rupees for that. He charged money for polishing also. The fraud that he is we knew he will not return the deposit, so we told we will not give the keys unless he returns the deposit. He gave us a cheque and took the keys, he later stopped payment for the cheque. His wife is very abusive and gets personal during discussions.<br />

Experience of tenants :  The owner was very friendly and polite. The deposit and rent were reasonable. I stayed for over 2 years, and faced no issue from the owner. Any minor issues I faced were promptly resolved as soon as I brought it to the owners notice.<br />

Experience of tenants :  Canopy Citadel<br />
A203, Agara Main Road, Babusapalya, Kalyan Nagar, Bangalore.<br />
I replaced a guy in a 3bhk this year in March but had to come to my hometown in April because of COVID and I have been here ever since. The other two roommates also moved to their hometowns in August and so we decided to vacate the flat. We called the owner in September to give our one month notice. He agreed. So a few weeks back we coordinated with the storage guys via video calls and moved all our stuff to storage. We called our owner informing him the same and requested him to send us our deposit (1.5 lakhs) back.<br />
This is when he took a u-turn. He said he never got a one month notice from us. Then later on he said, he was busy so he forgot about the notice. He next said we will have to stay till November as that's when the agreement of 11 months end (we proved him wrong as the agreement actually expired September end). Then he said he will visit the flat and see the damages and let us know. He visited the flat and called us to say that there was so much damage that he will deduct the entire deposit amount of 1.5 lakhs and even charge us extra for the damages.<br />
A few points to see here:<br />
Even though I moved to this flat just this year and might have stayed there for a month, the other two guys were in the flat since 2016. However, the owner has not done any maintenance work including painting the apartment since 2011. And the flat was in the same condition in 2016 as it is now other than seasonal wear and tear which is minimal. He says he wants the flat in the same condition as 2011. He never visited the flat in 10 years and now wants us who lived just in the last 4 years to pay for all these 10 years' damages. He never painted the flat in these 10 years but wants to deduct painting charges as well from us. He said he will get quotations for all the damages and send us the details.<br />
The worst part is he rarely picks up our call and hangs up when we start talking. He wants us to go to Bangalore and discuss the damages and quotations in person, even after we explained we cannot travel coz of COVID. So in short our entire deposit amount of 1.5 lakhs is with him and he is taking his own sweet time to decide things which obviously won't be in our favor.<br />

<br />
Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  This guy first show you flat and take all the advance in notes, not cheque( only cash ) before giving keys or anything. <br />
Flat will be actually bad and then you will have to wait till somebody else is vacating and someone will be in a week.<br />
<br />
Then you will be asked to stay in that flat and pay according to that flat and rent will differ by 500-1000. Coz you have given advance, you won't be able to say NO.<br />
<br />
Had to spend 1500 to get it all cleaned myself.<br />
<br />
Then after 3-5 months, he will increase rent by 2500 Rs and even if you have the document, he will ask you to vacate in a week or immediately.<br />
<br />
They take rent directly cash. Living Condition is bad too. Had to suffer with low and dirty water and also with frequent electric failure in society grid.<br />
<br />
I was in bad situation and searching for job and had came to Bangalore, not much aware about all this.<br />
I had to agree with all this.<br />
They are criminals. STAY AWAY.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes, took 20,000 extra unnecessarily<br />

Experience type:Bad<br />
Experience of tenants :  I took 2bhk house on rent shared with my friend on1 september, 2019 at Vishwa complex. Owner of that building is Vaijinath. Due to some issues, I wanted to leave the flat from april 1, 2020 and wanted to take a new one in AECS layout. So I informed my owner on 1 march in one month advance that I am going to leave his flat in april 1. I asked him how much money he will deduct as ideally he has to deduct only one month rent which we pay at the end of the month. He agreed to it and said he will deduct one month rent+ painting charge and I have all his call recordings too. As due to covid i had to leave flat on 21 march itself as lockdown was being implemented after 22 march. So i shifted and informed him  for which i had recorded our conversation too. Now when i shifted he said he will give me in next 10 to 15 days in that call and again confirmed  that he will deduct one month rent + half month as painting charges. But later i called him so many times he was delaying payments. Finally on april 20, He transferred money in which he deducted 2 month rent + half month painting charges. I called him and even my brother called him, he started saying it's on agreement. When we argued where it is there , that stupid owner started saying agreement is always for 11 months and u left before that's why i am deducting. Even in one month advance clause, he had mentioned for one month rent deduction only. That owner didn't give any money later even after multiple calls as he was repeating same statement not even agreeing or understanding any clause.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes my one month rent (12500 rs) has been taken extra plus painting charges (6000 rs) are deducted too which he said he won't deduct that much as house i left in good condition only. <br />

Experience type:Best<br />
Experience of tenants :  I had only stayed 3 months when covid happened. Since work from home stared I wanted to vacate the flat and move back to my hometown. Back in May 2020 my company had approved wfh till June 2021. The owner is really sweet and understanding. Even though the rental agreement was for 11 months she returned my full deposit without any issue. I just had to ask her once and she returned it within a week. There was no hassle or fight or any kind of issue. This is the best owner because according to the agreement I was supposed to give 2 months notice period. No one could have predicted corona. Even when I gave her 15 days notice she understood my situation. Hats off to her. <br />

<br />
Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  Major Issues:<br />
- Water unavailability due to delayed tankers in Summer.<br />
- Taps get spoiled frequently due to accumulation of silt and water flow is less.<br />
- The owner doesn't involve in our business, He doesn't also resolve issues. We were on our own.<br />
<br />
Other than that, the house, in general, is good.<br />
The locality is very good.<br />
Availability of facilities is very good.<br />
<br />
Our stay at the house was with minor adjustments, pretty good.<br />
<br />
The problems started when we decided to move out.<br />
- The owner charges `Moving Out Charges` of 1-month rent. This is additional to cleaning, repair, and repainting charges.<br />
- He refused to return our deposit until he finds a new tenant. We vacated in August 2020 and now it is Nov 2020 we still didn't get a single penny.<br />
- The owner doesn't even care about the tenant. He is very adamant and is a very cheap guy.<br />
- He charged full month rent even though we vacated on the 5th of the month I would have been okay had he returned the rest of the deposit.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes!!<br />

- After a lot of fight, out of 150K, he agreed to return 75k, deducting 54k as charges + last month's rent, and keep the rest towards repairs. He said he'll keep 20k and will return any balance after 1 month of the new tenant<br />
- The owner doesn't even care about the tenant. He is very adamant and is a very cheap guy.<br />

Experience type:Bad<br />
Experience of tenants :  The rooms are not that spacious for 1bhk. The apartment was not painted and cleaned properly and it was given to me. I shifted to Bangalore and wasnt aware about the norms. Then they will say they provide cleaning services. The way the cleaning person will clean you will feel they made your room more dirty. Even if you complaint there will be hardly any changes. While I was they told me that there is no additional charges other than eb and rent. But now I am getting g additional amount 3k to 4k for water and common place utility which they will never tell you at the time of taking up. They have a policy that you have to notify regarding the vacating by 5th after that they will accept your request. Even though if you vacate the house by the end of the month, they will still deduct those 5 days rent other charges from your deposit.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Dont know, I will vacate by the month end<br />

Experience type:Bad<br />
Experience of tenants :  The house was dirty at first. We had to get it cleaned by a maid. Electricity was an issue and the power cut damaged my induction and a power strip. However the society is very good and the maintenance is excellent ( but they charge huge). During pandemic it was vital to live in such society and my overall experience was great.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  The owner took a lot of money from the deposit. At first demanded 27k for painting, 5k for cleaning and 2k for pest control even when we lived for hardly 6 months. After a lot of negotiation she finally agreed (but talked quite rudely) to reduce the amount to 15k for painting, and 6k additional. So we had to give 21k extra for nothing! So first please talk to the owner about the terms and conditions before buying a flat. Ask everything you doubt.<br />

Name of pg/hostel/Apartment:  Colive  <br />
Address:  Colive Broadway, Junnasandra Sarjapur Road, Rainbow Drive, near Sarjapur<br />
<br />
Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  I stayed in one of the Colive properties in Bangalore - Colive Broadway. I was to shift to Bangalore in July, hence started looking for accommodation in June. I visited their website and got in touch with a sales representative. I won’t name her, because that’s irrelevant here (because I believe that everyone’s the same).<br />
She asked me about my requirements. I specifically told her that I would need two meals per day (and, a few other requirements, which I needed). She got back to me after a few hours and named a few PGs which provided two meals per day, one of them being Colive Broadway. I made the payment and booked a room there.<br />
I shifted to the property on June 30, I guess. Woke up the next day and saw only bread being served as breakfast. ONLY BREAD. When I asked the caretaker, I got to know that they serve ONLY BREAD and that too, EVERY DAY. (Imagine eating bread for breakfast every day). I brushed it off because I had other things to worry about.<br />
So, the 'you will get two meals a day' was a lie (not completely, but it was). Also, the ‘continental breakfast’ (that’s what they refer to the breakfast they serve) was discontinued all of a sudden.<br />
This isn’t the only problem I faced. I will list down the problems that I (and others who stayed there faced):<br />
1. Drinking Water: It has happened a lot of times that there was no drinking water. Complaining to the Property Manager was useless because all he offered was fake assurance.<br />
2. Mosquitoes: The common area (the ground floor which had a kitchen and a sit-out area) had a lot of mosquitoes. It was really difficult to cook something.<br />
3. Dishwashing Liquids: The dishwashing liquid that they provide is already of low quality. Even after that, the Property Manager adds water to dilute it even further.<br />
4. Cockroaches: Right after moving into the room, I found a lot of cockroaches. They are not limited to the room, though. They are there in the refrigerator, in the kitchen – possibly everywhere. Not once during my 4-month stay did I find any pest control is done.<br />
5. Manual DG: The DG that they have there is manual. In the event of a power outage, the Property Manager will have to switch it on himself. There have been times that there was a power outage for a long time, but the DG wasn’t turned on because the Property Manager was nowhere to be found.<br />
6. Quality of Dinner they serve: No comments on that. I would just say that the food I got at my hostel was far better.<br />
Also, you cannot use the refrigerator. Not because you are not allowed, but because your food (or anything that you keep there) will get stolen. There were allegations that the Property Manager steals a lot of times (though, I don't know the authenticity of such allegations).<br />
Within the first month of moving to the property, I heard about a few cases where the police came for inquiry (after getting complaints from the tenant regarding the security deposit).<br />
Fed up with all this, I decided to vacate the property and come back to my home (as I was anyway not required to go to the office till at least December 2020). A few days after raising notice to vacate, I got a call from their Relationship Manager asking me about the reason for vacating the property. I told him every problem that I was facing. He offered a deduction of 25% on the rent, but I denied it. (My point was, I already knew how much I will have to pay before I moved in, and I moved in because I was fine with the amount. My problem was not the high rent, but not getting the amenities that they had promised).<br />
I got another call from another relationship manager, who offered a ~10% reduction in the rent. (Seeing the deduction percentage reducing, I was worried that if I get another call, they may ask me to pay more rent. Kidding!). Obviously, I denied it.<br />
The Property Manager got caring all of a sudden and assured me that he will get me some deduction in the rent. (What kind of fool are they, is beyond my understanding. I and everyone who stays there, already know the amount of rent that will have to be paid. They don’t move out because of high rent, they move out because of the lack of amenities that was initially promised).<br />
I, anyway, moved out on October 30. The Property Manager was nowhere to be found for room inspection and taking the keys. I had to contact some other employee for that.<br />
Now comes returning the deposit that I had paid. According to their rental agreement, it should be returned on the 15th of the month. It was already past 15, and I had not heard from anyone about paying back my security deposit. After a few emails and raising service requests, they got back to me with…hold on a second…the amount that I HAVE TO PAY THEM. Funny, no?<br />
Here’s a breakdown of what I was charged for:<br />
i) Separation charges (justified, because it was already in the agreement)<br />
ii) Electricity bill for two months (justified, because they did not charge us for the first month (July) and last month’s (October) electricity bill was to be paid)<br />
iii) Damaged pillow (which was damaged before we moved in)<br />
iv) Damaged mattress (I don’t know what the damage was. I had used it for only 4 months.)<br />
v) Painting of walls (Again, no clue. The condition of the wall was the same for the entire time I had stayed there.)<br />
vi) Cockroaches (Again, I don’t know why was I charged, as if I was the one who kept them as pets there. Also, I had to throw away my helmet because of cockroaches; and here I am, paying for something which Colive is responsible for.)<br />
I have already raised a service request, but I don’t expect any response or resolution to the problem. Had they been so customer-centric, no customer would have faced any problem in the first place.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes.<br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  If you want crazy high electricity bills and crazy high water bills + unapproachable owner who is always busy and is never available to take your calls or solve your problems then please take an apartment in this building. The electricity is charged at Rs. 11.5/u after fighting for a year (we were paying Rs 15/u before). The water bill was charged at 9p/l for which we had to fight again. If you have the capacity to fight with the owner and waste 1 week every month or extra hard earned money then please go ahead and take the apartment. Please be very careful of the so called building managers (R&amp;K - yes there are 2) they are quite rude and useless. All R does is gossip and talk wrong things about everyone in the building as well as the owner. K will not help you with anything so please don't try to approach him.<br />

Experience of tenants :  The rent charged from me was 8000 + 300( water charge) but due to her income tax benefits she used to show it as 5500 and asked me to do the same. There was no proper parking space. They broke my new bike’s tail lamp and acted unaware of it.used to come in randomly to check and used to give me lectures about cleanliness and stuff. Used to call me randomly and ask unnecessary questions. <br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  I was about to vacate in Sep 2020 and she asked me to vacate in Oct since there was a 3 months notice period, then I’ve postponed my plan to go and vacate by oct end as shes gonna charge me oct rent as well. But she suddenly calls and tells me that she has rented out to someone and asks me to come and vacate at the earliest and that I don’t have to pay oct rent. So I went in the second week of Oct for which she has charged me rent for the 2 weeks.<br />

Experience type:Bad<br />
Experience of tenants :  The house is owned jointly by husband and wife and now the drama starts is the husband is not interested in renting the house but wife is. Wife doesn't mention any such thing to brokers, tenants and makes illegal rental agreement with just her name in it. Later when entering society during move-in we come to know that it's a joined owned flat and the wife is a mental patient in a local hospital. After a month's effort we were able to get back our security deposits, else the entire thing was screwed with neither husband nor the wife helping us out<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes, For a month it's was like begging for security deposit. Finally when the mental lady openly denied for the refund we called 100 and police came but she asked the police to handle the matter in court and send them back leaving us helpless at that moment. Thankfully my uncle was a court judge and her husband helped one day out of anger with his wife to get the money back.<br />

Experience of tenants :  House is not livable at all even for Bachelors, I stayed there with my wife for 6 months, had to beg him to get toilet fixed as it won't flush and the owners have the odacity to tell me that they are changing only because there's a women and also had to ask to fill gaps between the window and wall as they were wide open, water leakages during rains common ... Fast forward during leaving door was broken for which he took 2 weeks to tell me the cost that too without bills and I was in transit so couldn't respond and when I settled I pinged him to let's clear things he never bothered to read or reply to my messages. He charged 2 months extra rent with painting charges and door damage charges extra that too during covid times when my salary little unexpected. <br />
<br />
He charged me for water bill also after vacating the flat. Beware of such thief<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Never got any, owner didn't bothet to check my messages or attend calls. <br />

Experience of tenants :  Owner name is Swami. He took advance amount 75k and did not did any maintenance during the whole stay . Also, in rent agreement he cleverly modified the terms and conditions and introduced 2 months rent clause instead of usual 1month rent for painting charges. On asking him once I got the agreement after moving in, after 2 months ,he told that not to worry and its typo mistake and he will refund the amount and to trust his word. To make the situation more worse, on vacating the house in Feb he didn't paid even a single penny of the advanced paid. He boosts himself as he is a celebrity .  After being patient for more than 6 months , he credited around 40K citing we have damaged his house motor so he will deduct 2 months rent + motor repair charges (5K). In a way , I knew it was coming as they didn't even pay our househelp who used to come at 5:30 a.m. on our request to clean their house whenever they used to visit. More than money , its human feelings which these sort of people play with. Our househelp ,who has not uttered a single bad word against anyone in the last 4 years , also vent it out for the first time as she never ask for extra money but it doesn't mean you don't pay them (they paid 200 rs for 5 days work to do work for 2 floors) for all the help they do for you. <br />

Experience of tenants :  Owner is a utter shrewd money minded,  he will talk to you in such a sweet voice, but is actually a liar. He took the token deposit and since there was a lockdown, I was unable to shift and his flat also wasnt vacant. So when i asked my deposit back, he stopped all communications.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Had to resort to legal channels to get back, owner cut down all the communication and since he lives in canada, it was difficult to do anything.<br />

Experience of tenants :  The overall experience was not so good. The problem was with the irritating owner and strict rules she imposed. She is always cunning to loot extra money from the tenants and same happened to older tenants too. Please avoid taking this flat, if not be aware that your will be charged extra.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  The owner charged an additional one month rent which she didn’t inform earlier even though we were asked to vacate a month prior to notice period end date. Owner is rude and asked to do whatever we want but not even a single penny will be returned.<br />

<br />
Experience type:Bad<br />
Experience of tenants :  The house is decent, albeit very old construction. The society charges 4800 rupees as maintenance but doesn't provide any major convinience. The power backup is only for 6 hrs, in the evening. This is mentioned in a very small line on the society board. It's very difficult to find this, my broker and owner concealed this information from me. And the power cuts are very frequent in summer, it's really annoying when the power cuts at 2am in the night and doesn't come back till morning. <br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes, the owner wanted to retain the deposit for as long as he can. He finally gave us the deposit after 3 months of pleading him, and finally told him when I'm ready to take a legal action on him. The owner Mr. Chiranjeevi Reddy Valluri is a man of no values, he always finds a way to steal our money. There was a bathroom work that was done, a bathroom split, so when we asked for a new geyser, he forced us to buy the geyser ourselves and he won't pay a rupee extra for it. We didn't pay and adjusted somehow.<br />

Property provided by:  Self  <br />
Name of pg/hostel/Apartment:  Dreamz Suvidha  <br />
Address:  Radha reddy layout road, Sarjapur road, doddakanahalli<br />
<br />
Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  Anybody taking a flat for rent in Dreamz Suvidha, Sarjapur road beware of renting flat number 307, 2BHK flat.<br />
<br />
Stayed here for 4 years. I am thankful for everything and time there.<br />
<br />
But consider the following before going <br />
<br />
1. No furnishing in master bedroom. Minimal furnishing in kitchen (carried out by me when I was the tenant).<br />
<br />
2. The rent charged is the highest by this house owner for 2BHK without any furnishing or add ons.<br />
You get a fully furnished fitted with AC 3 bhk flat in same appartment for same  rent. Came to know much later. <br />
<br />
3. Huge issues with plumbing. I have with my money replaced 5 to 6 taps and 1 wall mixer in this period. <br />
<br />
4. The house owner is an octogenarian.  You will have to do everything related to the flat yourself. Do not expect house owner to do anything.<br />
<br />
5. Every rent agreement prepared between us ( 4 rent agreements), I had to get it prepared and delivered to him and also fully paid by me. The land lord refused to share the cost (500 Rs)<br />
<br />
6. Deposit was flat 1 lakh rs. (4.5 yrs back). The flat is 4.5 years old and bought at 25 lakh by the owner.<br />
<br />
7. You have 24/7 power back up . Just that no other ammenities.<br />
<br />
8. Water lines get clogged every other week. You will have to get a plumber and pay for it too. <br />
<br />
9. Parking is very limited for this flat. If you own a suv or bigger car, impossible to park here. <br />
Even for Santro it is with great difficulty you can park.<br />
I had to leave my Xuv at home and use my old Santro.<br />
<br />
10. Getting your deposit will be extremely difficult.<br />
<br />
Look at my follow ups with the flat owner and later with his daughter.<br />
<br />
* In 1st week of Oct 2020 intimated that I will vaccate in 1st week of November 2020.<br />
<br />
* Vacated on 6th November 2020.<br />
<br />
* House owner being an octogenarian, I arranged and perfomed the following<br />
<br />
A. Deep cleaning of toilets, kitchen and balcony.<br />
B. Repainting whole flat.<br />
C. Commode seat replacements.<br />
D. Fan cleaning.switch cleaning.<br />
E. Fixing of loose screws etc...<br />
<br />
Costed me around 20k (little less than a month's rent)<br />
<br />
* For next 20 days I had to follow up for getting my deposit back. <br />
<br />
* Which I received on 25th November. However amount remitted was only Rs. 76,000/-<br />
<br />
The elderly person held back Rs.24000, one month's rent for no reason.<br />
<br />
I even requested him to charge me half month rent for the 6 days of November I was there. But he very cunningly and sternly declined all my requests.<br />
<br />
These are the incidents which makes u absolutely hate people like him. You treat him as a super sr citizen and do things to his convenience. And end up being conned.<br />
<br />
Another insight.<br />
<br />
During the covid times majority of flat owners in Dreamz Suvidha reduced rent by 10% and more.<br />
But my land lord insisted I paid 10% more for the year 2020.<br />
<br />
In his speech he will come off as a pious person. Do NOT fall for it. We had a very civil relationship because everything I did was respecting his age. DO NOT do it.<br />
<br />
The parting revealed his true colors. <br />
Feel cheated. I can't do anything.<br />
<br />
Felt this is my only way to let people know.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes. I did the following out of my pocket<br />
A. Deep cleaning of toilets, kitchen and balcony.<br />
B. Repainting whole flat.<br />
C. Commode seat replacements.<br />
D. Fan cleaning.switch cleaning.<br />
E. Fixing of loose screws etc...<br />
<br />
Still the landlord deducted a month's rent from the deposit.<br />

Experience type:Good<br />
Experience of tenants :  Prime location, easy access to day to day needs, cordial neighborhood, owner minds his own business and is nice to socialize.<br />
<br />
A bit ingnorant to maintenance.<br />
Rent is a bit extravagant since there are no balcony and he would claim the house to be 1bhk but it's somewhere between a 1rk and 1bhk as the kitchen and drawing room are one single entity. He will claim the kitchen as open kitchen but it's just a fancy word.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  No. The deposit is like anyplace else in Bangalore. When I moved in his property for the first time I was broke af and just started a job and had limited money to get a place. The landlord was kind enough to give me credit and a month's time to pay my dues. I will always be grateful for that.<br />

Experience type:Good<br />
Experience of tenants :  The owner didn't impose any restrictions or interfere with the us during our period of stay. His manager was the only contact between us and the owner. As result, he messed up and the owner didn't take responsibility to provide us rent receipts. The society and people were decent but the management had absurd rules which was annoying. The management does not allow delivery guys after 9 o'clock and the tenant has to go down to get food. Although the guest is accompanied by the tenant, the security stops and ask the guest to add an entry in MyGate when the person that approves stands right next to him. The maintenance paid is not worth the amenities provided. (5000 on top of 28000) and the apartment doesn't have automatic generator. <br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  The owner kept prolonging the deposit for a couple of days. But, returned after that. <br />

Experience type:Bad<br />
Experience of tenants :  The owner took an advance of 50000.I had given 3 months of notice before vacating the house but still he never paid my advance amount on the date i was about to leave.<br />
He took 2 months more to pay my remaining amount of just 3000.<br />
In 50000 he charged 2 months rent(13000+13000) and 1 month charge for painting(13000).....So he had to pay me actually 11000 back....<br />
But he paid me just 3000.<br />
In the remaining 11000 he said he used the money to repair the geyser and taps of kitchen.<br />
While they had never provided with new geyser nor did he provide me with new water Tap for kitchen.<br />
He never used to accept money through net banking and always used to ask me for money in cash through hand.<br />
Even after i insisted many a times to provide money through bank account which he never agreed for.<br />
I feel owners like these suck the money out of tenants like us.<br />

Experience of tenants :  House was good. But the toilets are totally damaged. The behaviour of the house guard is very bad. The house is full of insects, like rats, cockroaches.. And the neighbours are sooo sensitive that if you laugh at your home at 12 o clock night, they will complain about it<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes, the owner took two months of full rent. He told us to clean tge house, we did it by spending our money, then he told cleaning is not proper and he again charged money from us. There he told so many dialogues like he did a mistake by giving flats to singles bla bla.<br />

I rented out an independent room on the terrace of his building(one of the three independent rooms on the terrace) in Feb 19. I served the entire lease period of eleven months  and  vacated on 24th March this year after giving a notice of one month. He had told me earlier that he would deduct one month rent for not serving two months notice. I knew the T &amp; C and agreed. Fifteen days after vacating, I called him and asked for refund of my deposit. He requested me to wait for some time as he was facing a few financial problems. Considering the effect of Corona pandemic, I thought of waiting for two months and reminding him again.<br />
Two months later, when I called him, he started speaking rudely to me and said in a straight voice that he doesn't have any money with him. He told that most people in his building had vacated and those that were there were not paying any rent. I got a hint of where all this was heading and asked him to stop bullshitting and talk about my deposit and when he planned to return it. He said to wait for some more time. I was left with no other option but to wait. A few days later, he Whatsapped me a shabbily written calculation of the refund amount(attached here).  I checked the calculation and called him to discuss that. But he started abusing me and said that he won't return the money if I keep calling him to ask about it. I threatened to file an FIR and post all the details on social media and see that he doesn’t find another tenant in the future. He was a bit indifferent initially, but later told shamelessly that he needs more time so that he can find a new tenant, and only after that he can give back my money. It's been over four months since that last call of mine and he hasn't uttered a word yet. He is not responding to any calls and messages. I have lost all hopes of getting back my deposit.<br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  Horrible experience. Firstly, I had paid ₹2,04,000 along with ₹30,000 security deposit from August 2019 to August 2020, even after that they emptied my flat on 7th June, 2020 without my knowledge. Secondly, I wonder why did the owners need to steal my things. <br />
I had to move to my hometown due to lockdown, while I was gone they came along with police and with the master key open the flat, broke the room's lock (as I had got it changed before I came home) and forced my warden to empty my cupboard. In this process they did not empty one cupboard which had a lot of my things - documents folder, books, iron, kettle, bedsheets, towels, soaps, shampoos etc.<br />
After repeatedly pleading the owners that my items were still there, they finally agreed in November to let me collect the remaining items. I couldn't find anything in that cupboard, only my books were there and my few documents were taken out and kept in a bag in that cupboard, rest everything was gone. The folder along with few documents and everything else that was there in that cupboard. <br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes, even after repeated reminders to the college I've not received the deposit. <br />

Experience of tenants :  The house owner also owened the full building and next one, he would not only constantly interfer but also peep in windows, call msg at all odd hours to raise new issues everyday. Every week he would find a new topic of objection. Finally he threatened to kick me out a single woman without returning my deposit in the middle of the night until I informed his actions to everyone in that building and the next. His wife stepped in, negotiated with me to leave early yet he went behind her and my back to talk bad abt me to my dad and ask for extra charges. Finally on vacating his wife was fair in returning the deposit but he had made my life hell in 8 months <br />

Experience of tenants :  Owner stays abroad and doesn't share even his contact number. Didn't face any issues over the period of our stay. But while moving out Owner charged us hefty amount for the renovation of his house. Also Nestaway paid only partial security deposit. We requested owner to intervene and help us. But he said that he is not related to it and Nestaway should only respond. We somehow contacted Nestaway and got to know that the security deposit was with owner. Then he responded saying that only after inspection report is submitted to him, he would refund the SD to Nestaway. And he never followed up with nestaway for any of this. After 2 months of follow-ups between nestaway and owner he refunded the amount to nestaway to a wrong account. Now after 1 month of follow up, nestaway says that owner has deposited to a wrong account. We are still following up with the owner and nestaway. We moved out on September 18th with proper notice to owner and Nestaway. <br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes. We only received 69000 from security deposit. <br />

Experience of tenants :  Owner never really cared about anything, even any repair maintenance guy will ask us to do it and pay , owner will call only to collect rents and after an year she will give a call randomly any month and say your agreement is over for 11 months and will intimate 10percent increased  and we nned to pay pending amount on following month.she will never bother to communicate early.when we were vacating the hosue she stopped picking the call and asked her to talk to her husband and he was travelling frequently (not sure it's true) finally after two months he picked the call  and sent a whatsapp message for the charges he deducted .we paid advance of 45k in 2014, he returned hardly 2.7 + last month rent which is 14k which made no sense and again stopped picking the call saying he is busy.<br />

Experience of tenants :  Ok this review is about Mr. Arun Saxena, who rented his 2bhk flat to me. <br />
The address is -<br />
B-009, Nimritha Kethana Eternal Accolade, Doddakannelli, Bengaluru 560035.<br />
He is a true gentleman who always talked kindly and called us time to time just to enquire about our well being. He was genuinely interested in the happiness of the people staying in his home.<br />
I used to pay 21k rent for this flat but today I moved out after transferring all my things to stownest. I had paid 60k deposit earlier and here are the best points -<br />
1. It's been hardly 2 hours that I moved out and I already have the deposit amount back.<br />
2. There has been NO....i repeat, NO deductions. No painting charges, no any other bullshit. I got my full deposit amount back.<br />
These types of owners are hardly seen in Bangalore. Most of the time, owners don't refund full deposits and tenants need to go through hell to get back a fraction. In fact, even I was a bit worried after reading so many bad reviews about owners in Bangalore. But this guy proved to be a gem. <br />
Currently, a new family has moved in and Mr. Arun was so kind to reduce the rent for them as it is covid time and tenants are scarce.<br />
So if you ever find this flat vacant in the future, grab it before anyone else does.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  No issue at all. Got it back within 3 hours of vacating. FULL AMOUNT.<br />

Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes as I explained owner deducted two months rent as notice. I've vacate within one month and owner told me he will deduct two months notice if couldn't find any other tenants but As I got to know he got other tenant still he deducted one month (20k) rent by lying to me about he couldn't find any tenant. What to say. Pathetic experience.<br />

Experience type:Bad<br />
Experience of tenants :  Very finicky landlord. He and his family keeps interfering with everything you do. You need to take permissions to even get something clean/fix in the house from an outsider, else they prefer doing it themselves. They deducted almost 3 months if deposit citing stupid reasons, even though we kept the house well maintained. He promised covered car parking initially, but did not give and we had to park our car in the open lane. Also there is absolutely no privacy in the house whatsoever, since it's almost covered from 4 sides with buses sticking to your chest. Initial days were fine..but later it just became unbearable to stay. <br />

Experience of tenants :  The house was managed by RentProp4U agency. During the pandemic when landlords were reducing the rent, our landlord increased our rent by 10%, making it expensive by 10,000 rupees when compared to others flats in the same society. <br />
<br />
We eventually had to vacate the house and almost 50% of the deposit was cut. <br />
<br />
Terrible experience. <br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes, deposit processing and refund took more than 2 months. A large chunk of deposit was cut even though the flat was in excellent condition. <br />

Experience type:Bad<br />
Experience of tenants :  Overall experience was satisfactory in terms of the appartment and society’s condition. Regarding the owner, she can be cunning and shrewd at times. She refused to share her PAN details during the first tenure of rent agreement. Also I am still facing difficulties in getting the refund of my deposit amount for which experience is shared separately.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes. While renting the house the owner used to say that I am not into looting business like other Bangalore landlords, and will refund full deposit after deducting minor amount for repairs. Now that I have left the house during the pandemic, she blames me that I have put her in difficult position as she is not able to find other tenants. She returned 60% of the deposit after begging  and following up for 2 months, but still holding onto rest of the amount for which I have no hopes.<br />

<br />
Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  The owner was somewhat helpful during the covid period, by reducing the rent by 30%. But it was not working out, we decided to leave by giving one month's notice. <br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  The owner took the one months rent even after informing him in advance. He is retired commissioner of police so we decided not to drag the situations. He charged hefty fee for missing items/cleaning. He will not listen to you and will try to loot you as much as possible. He will charge for things that are not even there in the rental agreement (for eg the carrom he left). He is saying that the carrom he left costs 27K INR. At first we thought that we will not even get the deposit, but after fighting a lot we got the 142000 Rs as deposit back. The rent was 35K (25K after covid rent deduction). There was no painting charges (it was written in rental agreement), but he took one month's rent extra.<br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  No electricity, No water for 6 months, everyday some issue with fan or tubelight or other connections, No security, neighbour issues, landlord does not pick on calling, have to call 5 times a day for whole week to make him come and solve issue.<br />
<br />
many issue, he took all the deposit as cash of 50,000 in advance, then he didn't give me the house for whole week.<br />
Main issue was he didn't follow the agreement, rental agreement was for 11000, but he charged 11500 for first 5 months then he comes and say IF he does not get 13000 from this month then I will have to vacate within a week. I was not well and was going through many family issues, so I had to comply for rest of the time.<br />
<br />
on leaving, he cut the entire deposit of 1 month as paint even when we had clear agreement of half the rent and then on top of that he took 5000 for geyser repair. I when understood the scam he was doing, I confronted him then he didn't even listened. scam was they will fit a 10 year old geyser in your washroom, then it will become faulty, the electrician sent by him will come and then he will say it require a new geyser, then he will check with the landlord and fit a new one and landlord says he will not take any money as this geyser will be used later too. but at time of vacating they will take money for the geyser from tenant. the old one is not faulty, they take out the insulation that ensure the geyser heat does not break the inside body. when I didn't gave him the keys, he deducted 4000 for a simple lock and so basically from my deposit I got back only 15000 from my 50,000 deposit.<br />
50,000 - 13000(month rent) - 13000(paint charges) - 5000(geyser) - 4000(door + cleaning) = 15000.<br />
<br />
they are literally gunda with political connections. Don't ever go there<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  yes, only got 15000 from 50,000 back<br />

Experience of tenants :  In the initial days the owner seems to be a nice lady in the cover of being a teacher. Informs us that Kaveri water is available through out, but we ended up getting two water tanker at least a week by ourselves. The amount was shared among the tenants who are living in the entire building. It turned out to be our responsibility.<br />
 We had to call her help many times as the motor was years old. The drainage got leak, water tank was dirty, we raised so many issues due to the unhealthy situation we had to live in. She started abusing all of us as we raised questionsa about the maintenance.  The previous person who stayed there warned us regarding her double face. But we didn't take it into account then. Later realized she asked him to leave the house when he asked for service and she didn't even pay him his advance. This lady consider it as a money machine. During covid time, she didn't even helped us while we were jobless and left with no money.<br />
She took two months money and extra some amount from the 50000/-deposit for a 12 year old house. We received only 5000/- rupees after begging her for almost two months.<br />

Experience of tenants :  14000 rent for a 1rk, small one too is already ridiculous. The owner used to drop a humble message 1st of every month reminding about the rent. First few months were great but then water problems started. That too for full 48-72hrs!!! Rent stayed the same and no solution was given. This happened twice a month for 4 months straight. Twice only did the owner get a water tanker and other times all 4 floors of the building stayed without water. I had to leave due to corona after which the real headache started. First day of my intimation they refused to give the whole advance - just because i was leaving before the 11 months mentioned in agreement (doesn't make sense i know). Then a whole lot of argument started which drained me mentally to the extent that I am still haunted by it. I don't get it, why is it so hard to find a place in Bangalore. Most of the people are void of humanity, and this thing came up especially in this pandemic. I heard stories from my Delhite friends and everyone was living at a reduced rent, refunds were also given without any issues. Bangalore is absolutely horrible in this arena.<br />

Experience of tenants :  Until covid came and I had to vacate after paying rent for few months without staying in the house, it was all good. Owner is a NRI, initially seemed cool. He even payed for complete deep cleaning of the house and replaced the RO. Never interfered. He once visited the house and didnt look into other rooms. He said that day that the only reason he had given house on rent is because it was costly to maintain the house. <br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Firstly my rude flatmates and house owner did not allow me to vacate. They both wanted me to pay rent till december and the owner did not give any reductions citing that you havent lost your job, why dont you want to pay. When I informed the owner that I would be vacating and gave two months notice (jun-july), his wife tried to convince me to stay, how will they find new tenant etc. Basically he and his wife were forcing me to continue paying rent till december. Luckily, my lease was expiring in Aug. My deposit covered more than 4 months of the rent. The owner asked for paying rent for the two months, I said deduct from the deposit. He replied very rudely and he and his wife both blocked me on whatsapp. <br />
I had to listen to words like he didnt carefully choose the tenants,  just because i asked for some concession since March i was staying at my hometown. <br />
The broker also behaved rudely and i had to finally email the owner multiple times for remaining deposit. I had to involve a lawyer at my end and I gave the owner official notice before going to file a complaint. Thats how I got my deposit back after deducting 4 days extra rent apart from notice period, society move out charges etc (without receipt)<br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  Experience with the house owner was Worst, we dint even stay for a day. When we went to see the house he lied to us stating one of the room is locked and the tenant who was in his notice days lost the bedroom key so will have to fix with help of carpenter. But he made us believe it has two bathrooms. <br />
<br />
We believed and paid the advance to move in but the house owner cheated us saying the 2bhk has two bathrooms which we found out to be a lavatory, which is within the compound and will be used by guests and everyone else. On knowing it has only one bathroom we refused to move in and demanded refund but he never returned our money even after visiting him for so many times. We got cheated. He was a Kannadiga and local person with good contacts so whenever we went to ask for refund he kept giving reasons and later started threatening and never returned the money. <br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  We made part payment of 35,000 (10,000 by cash and 25,000 by NEFT) as token advance but Did not get even a penny back. <br />

Experience of tenants :  neutral, this is my first place out of college. slight parking issue, no geaser, no dedicated tap for washing machine, nameshake 1bhk - rooms are small - I am almost running out of space here now. ll recommend this only for freshers living alone (max 2 people). colony is calm, there are couple parks behind in next street.

No water issue.  kitchen could use an exhaust fan.<br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  Owner installed faulty or poor quality geysers fans. Electricity meter replacement amount too expected to be taken by tenants. Does not take responsibility in any way. Increased rent during pandemic. Inhumane to the extent that when 1 tenant request some leniency due to salary cut in pandemic he asked the remaining people to bear the cost. Did not return 60k+ rs deposit. Extremely rude person and threatens with legal action as if lawyer is in family even though he is mostly doing illegal activities. Did not share PAN card number even though it exceeds tax cover.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes. Owner did not return deposit instead demands 15k extra on top of 60k withheld. Replacing geysers,renovation expense put on tenants. Remaining 60 k we compensated not paying notice period 2 month rent. extremely rude owner.<br />

Experience of tenants :  While leaving apartment she charged us 7000 for cleaning even though initially house was not cleaned. She added charges of broken cupboard (it was broken before we moved in )and it was clarified to her but still she deducted that amount. Plus she deducted charges for mineral accumulation on tap. When i argued with her she blocked our no. .she insisted on vacating on friday  and sorting out dues. But, she did not show up as discussed.  Her brother showed up. And he also kept telling us she will be coming soon. She had our 40k as pending deposit.  Luckily,  we did not pay a month's rent and some money was saved. We only got 14k returned out . She was rude. Shouted on us when we tried to reason. Just a horrible person.  Worst i must say.<br />

Experience of tenants :  Owner is kind enough to reduce the rent a bit as we are currently at our parents place and not planning to come back to bangalore until the WFH ends. However initially he was not so sure if he should reduce the rent or not because he has some 3-4 houses in bangalore and we are the only tenants who asked him to reduce the rent. <br />

Experience of tenants :  The owner was a decent gentleman, didn't interfere or anything while.i was staying there. It was live and let live, until the end. When it came to returning the deposit, he sent his son and sons lawyer and ended up wanting us to pay money, stating a million different reasons that were invalid. We got zero deposit back<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes. Nothing was refunded. He looked for every tiny reason to deduct money. Eventually took the entire deposit amount. <br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  Soak pit that overflowed and owner threatened on leaving the house - The house was on the ground floor and owner stayed on 1st. A soak pit inside the house would fill during rains and water would surface. The soak pit was in the drawing room area. The owner didn't inform this before renting the house and on complaining about this, they said we could stay in the bed room till rains stop. Didn't return a single rupee on vacating the house. Moreover, he tracked down the new house which was in the same neighbourhood and threatened when we kept asking for our deposit money.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes - not a single rupee was returned and we were threatened by the owner for asking for our money. Complained to the Police too but the police was of no help. Officer didn't meet us and the constable informed the owner that we were at the police station to file a complain. Owner called and said there was no use of complaining against him because he's a big shot in this area. <br />

Experience of tenants :  Experience in the house was good with compatible roommates but Nestaway had some issues with the owner of the flat. All of sudden they gave us notice to vacate the flat and to move into some other nestaway flats that too we have to separate from each other and have to look for other flats. Again there were issues with their dashboard clearance as they put all unnecessary charges on us. And they had deducted hefty amount from our deposit.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes, the deposit was 14k, but the refund amount was only 5k<br />

Experience of tenants :  If there was a 5th option if experience being 'satisfactory',  I would have opted that. House was excellent . No problems if anything happens, gets sorted shortly. Rent was bit much. I would have mentioned the stay as good but because of Corona and room being empty  for several months - 4 months around, owner didn't take single penny less than usual rent. If I put Corona factor away I am fine with the service.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Kind of yes, it was 2 month's rent which was pending and deposit was 60k . I would have got 3000 (after 1 month standard deduction in Bangalore) but couldn't get. <br />

Experience of tenants :  Huge problems with security refund<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  The whole issue started on the refund of the deposit. Having cleared out the space, we asked owner to inspect with us present to which she refused. Later putting a bill of 75k in our name. Paying a whopping 50k for painting. This, when the walls were cleaner than a blank canvas. The owner, shared the pictures of bedding (totally usable, that we left there because we couldn't move them back to our hometown) and gas stove (that was left by previous tenant) and said the house was dirty. They shared the pictures with no dirt, but said that it was. Totally unjustified deduction from security. Would not recommend. <br />

Experience type:Bad<br />
Experience of tenants :  It was kept so dirty, unhigenic, &amp; kept on adding electicity charges extra ,, which was told already included in rent . Even was taking different rent from different tenant... 7k or 8k or 9k&amp; even 9.5k who joined after me.<br />
Even they charge 1000 if you want to shift to another bed in another room. Which makes no sense. If shofing is towards another property of them then a bit understandable....<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Deducted 5k from deposite saying move out charges.<br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  Small house. Overpriced. Does not allow swiggy to come up. Visitors not allowed without prior notice. Not power back up. Constant power cuts. Frequent pigeon shit on balcony as there is no mesh. <br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes. My deal was with nestaway and I was paying rent to nestaway. In the middle of the year, he cut off the deal with nestaway and asked me to pay the rent directly to him. But my rental agreement was with nestaway. He said if I don't pay directly to him, he will cut off my water and electricity supply. So I paid directly to him and nestaway levied huge fine on me for it. Finally when it was time to return security deposit, he told me to ask nestaway for it. Nestaway deducted huge fine (32k) for not paying them directly. Owner didn't return any amount and I got the deposit of 68k instead of 1 lakh only after 4 months<br />

Experience of tenants :  While taking the flat the owner said that no amount will be deducted from deposit on vacating the flat if tenant informs a month prior of vacating.<br />
<br />
As it was a new building, he was desperate to rent us the flat later on he sarted showing his actual face. Sometimes we had to stay without wifi, electricity, water, washing machine for 10-15 days.<br />
<br />
We paid 18k for 1RK.<br />
<br />
Later we informed owner that we will be vacating after 45 days on which je agreed and share a form to fill. We did it. We vacated the flat on 31st March 2020 and asked for deposit money which was 50k.<br />
<br />
He told that due to corona he has lost some of his business and will return the money in 15 days.<br />
<br />
Today it is 9th month. He has still not returned the deposit. He never answers the call or msg. <br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes. <br />
<br />
Have not received the deposit money till today which is 9th month after vacating the flat.<br />

Experience of tenants :  Great experience overall; The owner was very attentive throughout our stay and resolved any problems we faced on a timely basis. He took extra effort to make our stay comfortable and when we wanted to leave due to personal reasons, he tried his best to make it easy for us and worked around our schedules to show the house to prospective tenants. It was like leaving a family for us when we left.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  No issues at all. On the day I handed over the keys, my owner said he'll transfer the balance advance after deducting the painting charges within 2 hours and he was true to his word. He also didn't bother checking the house and mentioned that he trusts us and came to just meet us for one more time<br />

Experience type:Best<br />
Experience of tenants :  Great experience. The houseowner John is a great guy overall and very hands-off. His expectations were simple - treat the house like your own and don't bother the neighbours too much. That's pretty much it. He stays in Kochi while renting the property in Chennai and the rent was quite low even within the society. It was a 2200 Sqft (Carpet area) duplex and other landloards in the society were charging between 33 - 38000 while John was charging us 22000 as rent. He was very cordial to deal with and whenever we had any issues, he asked us to get it fixed at our cost and deduct it from the rent without questioning or demanding any proof or making us jump through hoops. He also returned my advance right on time. <br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  No issues at all. He mentioned that he'll return my deposit within 15 days of vacating the house, after adjusting for the next month's EB bill, water bill, and maintenance as the bills usually take up to 15 days. He returned it on the 10th as soon as the bills were sent to him on the 9th. <br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  Worst society and owner. The owner Krishnappa is an ex-cop and influential person, he only rents the house to women (1.55lacs) and he won't return a penny from that, you won't be able to do anything as even cops won't listen. The society is very orthodox, the guards would make personal comments on the dressing and won't let any visitors in even your family/friends/boyfriend or even they would stand behind every time the food delivery guys came in, they would make moral judgements if you came in late after 10 pm and have refused to open the gate at 2 am for us ladies, we had to call someone and fight just to get into our own house, the owner also makes blatant judgements and personal comments, it's a very very toxic society, I won't advise anyone to be part of it <br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  yes, the owner said he won't be able to return anything citing painting and repair of one kitchen cupboard and blocked us, he didn't return a single penny, we kept messaging him but still he never replied back<br />

Experience of tenants :  I stayed at 103, DSR Daffodils, Bellandur. The owner's name is Mr. Vikram. <br />
My experience was excellent with the owner. Although i had some issues like with my flatmate but rest assured the owner is so sweet. <br />
Not even once did he harass me or my flatmate for rent. Whatever might be the problem with the amenities of the house he would get them rectified as soon as possible. <br />
I would have lived there very easily if things were easy between me and my flatmate. <br />
Plus had to vacate due to Covid. <br />
While vacating the flat, the paint in my room came off at some places and the room was a mess with vegetable oil spillled all over. He just charged me 2k for deep cleaning and returned the entire deposit on time<br />
I had a wonderful experience with the owner. <br />

Experience type:Bad<br />
Experience of tenants :  Bad experience as the room was made by putting wooden partition wall in the hall. The bathroom was big but still poor. The building looks dilapidated even though not that old. Some of the lowest rent paying flatmates were so selfish to save their rent that when they were unable to find replacement they wanted to vacate house. They had the contract on their name and had cheated another tenant by charging more rent for similar room. They dealt with the landlord and made mess of the situation. They caused all others to unnecessarily lose money and lose more than they did. <br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Had given notice after agreement expired at the end of June. Landlord asked to vacate at the end of August. Landlord then told at end of August that counting the notice period from July so only one month is done so one more month is left. Had already looked for another place by then so had to pay rent for both places. Were vacating as other tenants who were leaving town could not find replacements. After deducting the notice period rent including the extra month and painting charges only some other small deductions were made and the rest was given back. <br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  Worst experience. I am being harassed by the landlord. They have not given me an agreement when I started living here, I have been paying rent for 7 months without an agreement. Now they are not only deducting my one month's deposit which is as per agreement that does not even have my name in it they are also charging me rent for next month  even though December has been my notice period. They did not deduct any money for the previous occupant of my room as I replaced her in that room when she left. Though the house is in mint condition, zero damage ( I mean this, the walls, the cupboards, kitchen everything is in the same condition as it was given) they claim they need to get it painted as new tenants would want fresh paint smell. They also want to cut next month's rent additional to the paint cost even though this is not mentioned in the agreement ( again I'm not part of this agreement).<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  They want to reduce one month's rent for paint and cleaning. They also want to reduce next month's rent which is not even mentioned in the agreement. Why none of this is fair is because I have been paying rent since 7 months without even having an agreement yet they are trying to impose whatever is written in the agreement on me and also add additional costs <br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  Nightmare. Severe water shortage and water was released by the landlord in the early morning. There was very tiny window to use water in the early morning. Otherwise water pressure died down when other tenants started using. Other tenants had better water pressure throughout. The rental agreement was shown after deposit was paid and crazy terms were put in the agreement that were not revealed earlier. <br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  The crazy terms of the rental agreement that were not revealed when moving in were put on agreement after deposit was paid. The agreement required replacement if vacating within the tenure. Had arranged replacement but landlord slapped somebody in the street who was talking to that tenant and telling about the water problem in the area. This slapping spooked the tenant and that tenant left. Found another tenant then. This tenant was not getting signal in the place so landlord offered another vacant flat in that building on another floor and all was well. Then lockdown started. When deposit was asked back then landlord said that tenant did not count as replacement and that deposit will be used to pay for the vacant flat rent in the lockdown and refused to pay back anything. This despite the landlord always taking my help for posting ads and got many tenants through my ads on magic bricks. <br />

Experience type:Bad<br />
Experience of tenants :  Landlord is greedy. Our agreement was renewed twice in 1 year i.e. each time someone old left. Both times our rent was increased. It was increased in total by 16.6 percent within an year. Our agreement was nothing but typed on A4 sheet with no stamp. We asked multiple times to give us a stamped copy or give his pan card but both requests were ignored. On leaving the apartment 1 month rent was deducted along with other charges. We never broke anything it was all normal wear and tear and we kept the area clean still they were trying to churn out money from us for the emi. Earlier only I wanted out in month of Sept so informed the landlord and started looking for replacement but realised no one is shifting in Bangalore in Oct-Nov 2020. Once I told owner about this he told me to forget about the deposit and "GET LOST".  He stopped responding to my texts and calls since then. Because I was still on 2 month notice so removed my stuff and stopped paying rent for my notice period to save as much as possible from my deposit. I was anyways loosing on my setup cost. Later my flatmates decided to leave as well because they did not want to pay full rent. On this landlord sent caretaker to the apartment without our permission to evaluate the condition of the flat and clicked photographs of the house. Mind you only I had vacated at this point. My flatmates stuff was still there. Finally he returned only a fraction of the deposit. I am not divulging all the headaches and arguments that were involved in the process of getting back the money from him because I do not want to relive through it. There were also instances of bad maintenance in the building throughout the time when I stayed there. <br />
Points to note:<br />
1. There was no water in taps for a month.<br />
2. There is no cellular reception for jio in the apartment. You cannot survive without WiFi. <br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Luckily stopped paying rent on the notice period so received nothing in return. You could say I recovered 2 months of my rent at cost of verbal abuse and multiple headaches. <br />

Experience type:Bad<br />
Experience of tenants :  My House landlord was good until I was leaving in the house. But when I was leaving the house due to Covid-19, as I was shifted to hometown, things started to change. Firstly, I asked him to plan how he will give my advance, firstly he started to ignore my calls. But when he picked my call he started to ask to give my house keys to him, to show my house, but how can I give house keys to anyone. Also he has vacant home above my floor which is exactly same, but he was not showing that flat. Also my landlord was acting very strangely, and was not discussing anything about my advance, and how he will give my advance , these things forced me to come to Bangalore , otherwise I was vacating the house by my relatives. But when I reached Bangalore, he said he will deduct three months’ rent as, It was mentioned in my agreement. I tried to convince him to give me some discount on reduction, but still he does not provide any discount on reduction. That part still understandable. Then we decide how much he will deduct from advance and he ask he provide him the return date, so that he can arrange the money. Week before I was leaving Bangalore, I asked him how he will return my money. Then started all the excuses that he didn’t have the money, he showed me his loan status and all rubbish things. Then I thought , it his problem , when I asked him to reduce the rent , he didn’t do that , now he is expecting me get money after some time , why . When I came to house, I give him all the advance before entering the house . He should also give the money before I leaves. Then I have to butter him up ad that was hell of a week .Then the day before leaving, I asked him , how he will give my money . He was still coming with excuses, then he don’t know how much money he will give, he may give half also. Then the next day , he give the money and Rs 6000 he said to give after some time. Then after some time I call him , he yells at me and said “I have given you the money , I will not run with money . I will give when I have the money”. Then after contacting him for few times. He returned the money. This is my whole experience, where I got the experience that if tenant is 1 day late from paying their rent, they will come at us like we are the criminals and also we are leaving the House , we are criminals ad our advance is their property , which they can return at any time.  <br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes , I have already explained in above<br />

Experience of tenants :  The house was 2 floored pent house. I was in a store room converted room which was smallest and it didn't have attached washroom. The washroom was 1 floor below (another store room converted to washroom). The washroom had water logging problem as the tiles ground wasn't inclined for a washroom (it was a store room converted to washroom). The washroom was the smallest and the hand wash area was a small area just inside washroom with height of 5.5ft. Told owner multiple times to get non-solar geyser fixed but he didn't listen. The guy managing owners pg is the rudest. Didn't refund deposit. <br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes. Never got back my deposit. I was told I would get my deposit back once my replacement is there. The day I left immediately next day my replacement was there but the guy managing the pg flat refused to give refund even though I gave 1 month notice. <br />

Experience type:Bad<br />
Experience of tenants :  The owner stays in USA and is a very sweet talker, and he promised a lot of things he will fix before moving in. At the end we got stuck due to pandemic and he charged 40K as deductions from 1.2 lac deposit after moving out. He is unreachable for menial task like rental agreement etc. Whenever he comes to India, he will make multiple trips to the house everyday, and walk around the flat looking at everything, as if we are trying to hoodwink him.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  The owner charged the full notice period inspite of his assurances over Whatsapp chat that he will not do so.<br />

<br />
Experience type:Bad<br />
Experience of tenants :  The owner stays in the building itself and can be helpful and interfering at same time. Random restrictions. Totally money minded.<br />
<br />
I had left the house 4-5 days before my contract was getting over but had still kept the keys with me as minor stuff like water bottles, oil cans, some utensils and some hanging cloths were still there. The owner asked to give him spare keys to show the house if and I gave him trusting him. He got a cleaning crew to clean the house while my stuff was still lying around. Now some of my stuff is gone and he is saying the cleaning crew must have taken it away.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Not much.... But there was that hanging sword of if he will or will not give.. He has given a cheque.. Waiting for it to go through. <br />

Experience type:Best<br />
Experience of tenants :  <br />
I am vacating my flat next month and so today i called him for settlement.<br />
He isn't even bothering to come and check house..he said "Your one month rent will be deducted for painting charges from your deposit and nothing else as we decided at starting of tenure."<br />
However this is big house and from this group i came to know owners deducted 25k to 30k for painting 2bhk. He settled on 15k.<br />
I myself had to inform him that i have broken a window glass to which he said no issues you check out in market how much it will cost and pay to me.. I will get it fixed or if you have contact u get it fixed.<br />
During covid time too i was out of town and didn't paid rent for 4 months. He said me to pay half rent for lockdown period on his own.<br />
Never had restrictions for stay, my friends visited regularly.<br />
He always said me "bhai bahut party karta tum.. Mujhe b bulata ya nahi kabhi" 😂 his only condition was neighbours shouldn't get disturbed by your activities.<br />
<br />
P.s the home is in residential area ground floor, and wasn't even meant for bachelors.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  No. As per agreement deductions were made and he said will refund as soon as i give him keys. <br />

Address:  Opposite Zeus Unisex Saloon, Near Kundalahali Signal<br />
<br />
Experience type:Bad<br />
Experience of tenants :  It was overall a bad experience. Owner wouldn't receive calls when needed and his security personnel was worst. <br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  A week back when we had some problem with the shower and asked him to fix it, he sent a guy. But the guy left as soon as I said the cost will be borne by owner. And the owner then texted us 5 new condition including any minor repairs is on us in the pretext that he forgot to add those terms in the agreement. Before that his security personnel also misbehaved with us and wasn't cooperating in anyway. So we decided to shift and communicated the same to owner. He said that as per agreement we've to give one month notice or to buy out notice period and some other charges as well , making clear of his intention that he isn't gonna give us a penny from our security deposit. So we said we'll serve the notice period vacating the building by January end and he can deduct December and January month's rent amounting to 20k from the deposit and can keep the rest 10k for refurbish purposes as mentioned in the agreement (even though we just stayed for 3 months and there's no damage and no repainting needed ). But he is insisting us to pay the rent for December saying that our due is beyond the security deposit. I clearly know he is planning to keep all the amount to himself.<br />

Experience of tenants :  Sharing the flat with others was okay. But Nestaway's service is really bad. They don't maintain the flat at all and close the tickets without working on them. While vacating the flat they charged rediculous things and deducted amount from my deposit.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes, they deducted the amount from deposit for ridiculous reasons like shower not working etc. even though everything was working fine and I shared the proof to them.But Nestaway stops responding as soon as a person leaves the property.<br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  worst experience.There were so many issues. Building chambers will overflow in every quarter.Owner will throw water on stairs make the ground floor dirty. There was electric wiring issue due to which many appliances got defect. House has got termite. All of these issues owner used to ignore stating that they have used number1 things for the house. Owner will behave very decent on face but as soon as we left the house he refused to return the deposit stating that all money went in repair and we should pay him more amount for the repair. He changed his kitchen cupboard which we are not sure about as his house has got termite in the kitchen which had been informed to him 2 years ago but he said that nothing like that.This house runs on a tanker water and you have to remind every time to the owner for water and almost one day you have to be without water. His name is Sanjeev Kumar T C. Topping this building with a cherry ,the neighbour is also very dangerous who will put disco lights in the parking which will directly enter in the master bedroom and bother whole night and owner wont take any action. So overall don't go by the house look but it has got many defects which you will learn as long as you stay there. The worst part is when you will leave he will not return even a single penny instead he will ask more money from you.Not only this we left out ceiling fan and ups and one wooden cupboard there as we  were relocating from the city. Everything he just digested.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes. He refused to pay the deposit back stating whole amount went in repairing the house. First he said he will deduct one month rent and later on he refused to pay .<br />

Reason for choosing the house/PG : We had a pet dog and finding a house with pet becomes difficult. So we chose this house also our kid school was nearby.<br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  I rented and stayed for almost the entire year, completing the tenure in the contract. Paid rents and bills on time even during Covid without any support from the landlord. When I told him 2 months before the renewal of the contract, he said I have to pay for a month extra and asked me to return the original contract. Now that I have left the property, the landlord is not taking my calls or replying messages, not returning my security amount due. He is acting like a goon and the only way is to go legal on him. Hence I have been to Hsr police station several times and met the acp but they only took action when I approached Dcp Gowda. The police finally got irritated with me as I had requested them couple of times and they just asked to have patience. Plus I made the inspector call the landlord and they were smiling and talking like friends. I couldn't understand as they conversed in the local language. Even the police showed me that there are many complaints against the landlord but no action till now. There is a clear nexus between police and these goons and i have been mentally and physically harassed as I do not belong to the state, I think. Please be aware of this place and the landlord.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Like I mentioned above, the landlord has been not taking my calls and when police came in the picture, he said will pay but not the complete due. Clearly said to the police I will pay 8,000 rs less than the due amount of 38000 rs. I do not have a job since the last 7 months and my savings are also over but I have to beg for my own money.<br />

Experience of tenants :  Never take flat in this apartment and from adithi shelters broker.<br />
Complete apartment is owned by one owner who never cares to talk to you or respond to calls. He will always redirect to broker.<br />
Broker will ask to drop email about issue or even to discuss about rent to their id which they will never reply even after sending multiple reminders , sending msg on whatsapp or calling them.<br />
We are asking them to reduce the rent but no response. Currently we paying 24k while they are quoting 20k for new tenants. For any plumbing issue, their plumber will only come who will charge much higher prices .They have their own internet connection which is worst. <br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Still staying here <br />

<br />
Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  30 months<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes. When I initially rented the 1 RK, the contact person was Mr. Narayan Kutty who seemed very polite at the time. Within a month, the thermostat of the geyser had to be fixed (It was mostly on the verge of break down when we moved in). The owner promptly handed us the bill after getting it fixed. After negotiations, he insisted that we pay 50%<br />
He had provided us with a refrigerator (very old one probably 18years+) which seemed a good deal for a bachelor while renting out a place for the 1st time. He had also provided us with a metal cupboard without the keys to the cupboard and the safe (which we didn't mind because what will a bachelor need a safe for?) <br />
When the time came for us to move out, he sent in his Son for inspecting the house for damages. The son turned out to be a scamster! The refrigerator (due to age) had rusted at the door hinges. He blamed us for DAMAGING it. The rent was around 7000 for the 1st year and after the mandatory increase, it had reached around 9.5k. Ideally a month's rent is not returned by owners for Painting charges. But, this Son of a landlord decided to utilize his negotiation skills to trap a couple of bachelors. <br />
9500 - Mandatory one month rent for painting charges,<br />
3000- Refrigerator hinge damage (It was due to rust &amp; age),<br />
Cleaning charges- 2500,<br />
Tried to charge us 5000 for LOSING the cupboard keys (which by the way we didn't receive), but after tough negotiations, he decided against charging us. <br />
I always thought that I consumed too much electricity every month &amp; thought that electricity was expensive in Bangalore. It's only after I moved to a different place did I realise that there was something fishy in the setup here. My bill used to run up to 800 - 1000 a month. My new place, my usage is around 350-400 a month. I suspect that the water motor is connected to the tenant's electricity meter! No proof. I would have investigated further if I was an Electrical engineer.<br />
The reason why we stayed here was only because we didn't have ample time to search for a good place with privacy.<br />
PRIVACY- Is something you can't expect in this property. Friends not allowed, when you open the main gates, a bunch of curious eyes stare at you from the landlord's house in the ground floor. He may walk into your establishment anytime he deems fit. Though there were 3 separate families living here including the landlord, we were sole reason if the water tank got empty 😂<br />
But, the Daddy owner decided to give us bear hugs as a parting gift because the other neighbors always thanked him for renting his house to "Well behaved bachelors".<br />
Again, do not deal with the son. <br />

Experience type:Good<br />
Experience of tenants :  The house is actually managed on behalf of the owner by a person named Vikas. Never seen the owner actually hence not much chance of interference from there. No interference from Vikas either, except the occasional person from the bank who would come to take pictures for loan purposes. After 4 years, stated painting charges to be 26k, which we negotiated and brought down to 11k. Lazy with respect to renewal of rental agreements, came back after 3 years saying why we were not filling new rent. We said because you never gave the new agreement. He created agreements in back date and asked for money. We denied, and again negotiated to come to a middle ground. Other than these two issues, no other problems faced and it was a good stay at the place.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Except the huge painting charge deduction that was planned, our deposit was duly calculated and returned.<br />

<br />
Experience type:Bad<br />
Experience of tenants :  Kindly do not rent any accommodation in SGR Lavilla, Doddakannelli. The owner is pathetic and no matter how well you maintain the place, will deduct more than one month's rent towards painting n other charges (that too after keeping your deposit for another 60 days post vacating the accomodation and after giving the notice > the period mentioned in the contract). The apartment itself is anti-tenants as the other owners harbour constant animosity against the builder (the owner whose accomodation I rented) and takes that out on the rent payers with rules like lift cannot be used for luggage, blaming rent payers for every nuisance that happens in the society. They even control the maids and car cleaners working in the society. <br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes, the owner deducted close to 24k stating that he did painting n cleaning when in actuality he didn't even painted it. The refund was given after 100ish calls and 2 months. <br />

Experience of tenants :  The house renting was taken care by the broker named Rajah who is an arrogant short-tempered sly guy, who will sweet talk you when showing the house but once the token amount is paid he will be literally the opposite, will cut the call when you refuse to pay the deposit without an agreement first, get agitated and be rude. He takes his share from the owner. Now I was contacted by Bindhu Sasi on facebook, so I had to pay half of the month's rent to her, and she instructed Rajah to show me the apartment. Now Bindhu Sasi is generally a fine sort of individual as far as my phone conversation went, yes she conducts her business solely through calls. Now to the owner, the owner is an HR guy and is around my age i.e. in late 20s, he didn't even clean the flat before transferring despite telling him beforehand that we will move with all furnitures from Bangalore. Then he got a little miffed when we pointed that out. The flat was not well maintained and many things started to malfunction but it was always an argument most of the time to make him take responsibility and pay for those, although those barely cost 500 rupees. Now there was a problem with the ACCL and I had to pay 2-3 thousand when its mentioned in the agreement that establishment related costs are to be borne by the owner. That's all, end of rant<br />

<br />
Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  Please beware of this owner- Namratha. Flat no :3003 Saaya Serene. Her current tenants were finding a replacement quoting rent as Rs16k and deposit 75k. When I agreed to move in, they said<br />
1)Now deposit is 1 lakh with no logical explanation<br />
2)you will not get a contract . you give us the deposit and we will give it back to you<br />
3)Landlady wants to increase the rent<br />
I questioned why has the deposit suddenly increased to which there was no logical explanation. Ofcourse this cannot be a typo. I told I will not give any money without a contract. If landlady wants she can keep a 6 month contract post which she can increase the rent as she would have after they had completed a year.<br />
I spoke to the landlady and she did a u- turn saying that she does not know why her tenants had quoted a lower deposit but it was always 1 lakh per person. I told her I am okay with it but provided she mentions in contract that no painting charges will be deducted from my deposit as she was not getting the house repainted and previous tenants had stayed there for 1.5 years. She agreed to it.<br />
She shares a format of contract at 10 PM just before a day I was supposed to move and give her the deposit. She wants 1 lakh per person as deposit and quotes 50k on the agreement!! No mention of painting charges not being deducted. Instead she writes that tenant will bear cost of any damage including painting. i tell her to change the clause to include that painting amount will be deducted only after giving a proof that any damage was done after current tenants vacate. I agree to give her 20k as token and move in and remaining 80k after signing the contract. i had quoted my move in date to her 15 days in advance and asked her to check every damage in the house and get a deep cleaning done before i move in(mandated by bbmp). Nothing was done, I was supposed to report her the damages a week after moving in, she did not agree to document those on contract, then she uses words like I cannot let you in, I am a lawyer but you go get the contract drafted to you are acting difficult(she had nothing to lose, she is holding the deposit of the current tenants). I chose not to have any dealings with such a person who has 0 integrity at all in terms of commitment. I have never seen a more greedy house owner in my life. I read posts where owners are okay getting deposits in 2-3 months installment and here she was pressurizing me for a fault of her own to make an upfront payment of 1 lakh when she did not draft the agreement as agreed and communicated earlier. Then she is acting as if she is being considerate by letting me rent her house. Really!! Don't these landlords live on our rent and feed like a parasite on the huge deposit we give them!!<br />
<br />
<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes, in the agreement owner was not ready to add the clause that deductions will be only after she shows proof of damage. deposit quoted wa different from the one she wanted. also wanted to increase ret in 6 months<br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  The experience was a pathetic one. When I had a conversation with the owner while checking the house he was all sweet talks. He mentioned that he had worked in IT before and therefore knows thre receipt and PAN thingy and agreed to provide the same. However, once he gets the deposit money he will never pick up the calls or reply to whatsapp texts potraying that he is the busiest person on the planet. The monthly rent is looked after by his wife and she too will reach out only when she needs to confirm whether you have sent the money or not. Otherwise, she is always unresponsive. I had later on asked them to send me the rent receipt and PAN details, the husband did not respond and the wife asked me to vacate the house. I had a big argument with them regarding this. Guess what, I still did not receive the details. They had not even fixed the toilet flush before renting the flat and I had to ask them multiple times to send a plumber to fix it. Only after 3 months of moving into the apartment, I started facing issue with the house. The paint started chipping off from the walls in the hall and the bedroom walls showed seepage. It was a middle wall with no water pipes and I still wonder what caused this seepage. I called the owner multiple times and even pinged him but there was no response. He just sent me the plumber's number. The plumber did not take any interest in fixing the issue and mentioned that this issue happens in all the flats. Gradually the paint started chipping off from all the walls and the house turned totally uninhabitable. Moreover, the flat faces water issues and they take a lot of time to call the tankers. The owner's wife runs a hydroponics business and they have all the set up on this apartment terrace and use up the water. As a result, the tenants face water problems. Also there is problem with the house plumbing and other tenants had put up complaints about dirty water entering there kitchen and bedroom. The apartment does not have any power backup although it has a lift which either smells because of dead mice or does not work properly. The owner takes a lot of time to address the issues and will remain unresponsive for most of the time. Also be ready to find a pond when you step out of your flat door after a heavy rain. The stray dogs also enter the apartment and sleep on the stairs thus blocking the path. The corridor lights are turned off after 10pm and the whole apartment turns completely dark with not even a single light on. I had severely sprained my ankle because of this.<br />
<br />
They do not provide the rent agreement when you shift and need continuous poking for providing the same. Also, there is no rent renewal done by them. That will be your own headache. I had timely informed the owner before vacating the flat and had asked him to return the deposit money when I hand over the keys. Still he chose to remain unresponsive and did not return the deposit money. The other outgoing tenants have also faced the same issue and have lost their security deposit. The owner does not provide any bills for water usage or maintenance and definitely charges surplus amounts. Had I known all these before moving into the apartment I would have never moved in that apartment.<br />
<br />
I know this is a long explanation. However, I hope this helps the other people looking out for flats and they do not face the same problems that I have. This apartment should be avoided at all costs if you want some peace.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes<br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  I've been a victim of flat deposit refund "scam" in Bangalore for more than a year now.<br />
My old landlord has not returned my deposit amount since Septemer 2019. He is supposed to return Rs. 65500. After numerous calls, we somehow were able to get back Rs.25000. He is yet to return Rs. 40500.<br />
He always gives excuses like his grandma died, he's at hospital, he's going through economic crisis, etc,etc .<br />
I didn't get time to follow back on him since March after the covid outbreak. So, I called him on October 2020. He again gave excuse that he's at hospital and he has no money as no-one is renting the place after covid. He asked for 2 months of more time.<br />
This is January 2021 now, and he has stopped picking my calls.<br />
I'm currently staying in my hometown in West Bengal so I cannot physically approach the Bangalore local police station.<br />
Kindly help me with any way of getting my money back.<br />
My personal advice is to not stay in the flat at this location unless you want end up the same.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  yes, 40k refund still pending for more than a year<br />

Experience of tenants :  The apartment is nice. Semi furnished with wooden flooring. On 6th floor with clubhouse view. Railway tracks are a big nuisance with this flat. Rent is high like any flat in PSN. Last rent we paid were Rs 33600. Owner is cool. Does not interact during the stay. Pay him rent any time of the month. However, deducted rent for 9 days as we gave notice late and a 3.5K of cleaning charge. We also got the flat painted for him. He gave us that way. <br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Owner is willing to give the deposit. However, not received yet at the time of writing this review.<br />

Experience of tenants :  The owner  basavaraju is not seen much. His wife and son chetan will talk to u mostly. At first they seem all nice. But they treat u like some labourer. Because they have many small homes which they rent out to migrant labourers and stuff. So they treat us with same demeanour. Any repairs etc we should meet and fight with them to get it done. They make silly issues which make u seem they don't have common sense and basic respect/concern towards tenants.We always had some or the other issue like parking bikes. In covid they have agreed for half rent as me and my flatmate have come back to our native. That too because we have said we will vacate the flat. Else owner was giving us 10% concession. Owners son chetan took rent for covid time. We have still yet to receive deposit amount. They are giving some or the other excuse to return back deposit.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes. Owner giving excuses . Notice period over <br />

Experience type:Best<br />
Experience of tenants :  Pretty good &amp; well built house. Owner stays with his family next door but have had no interference from him, apart from request for no loud noise at late night and no smoking in balcony. Regarding deposit he has agreed to charge on actual costs incurred at time of leaving, and will not do any mandatory deduction. However deposit is really high. Owner is quite friendly and has lent me his extra sofa with no cost/deposit. Society is excellent with lot of facilities and helpful staff. It's very well located. Had some issues with the MCB initially where it kept tripping during power cuts. But society staff helped to fix it.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Not yet, still staying there. My guess is there won't be much issue.<br />

Experience type:Bad<br />
Experience of tenants :  It was horrible. Firstly, upon trying to book online, amount got debited and no booking id was generated. Second time, I got a booking id and a room no. Upon going to the property, there was a person alreay staying in that room. There was no one to help, no customer care to address. The caretaker just gave me a bunch of keys to choose and stay in any room. I did so and mist of the rooms were smelly, suffocating with pungent smell, bedsheets were worse than on tbe footpaths of a railway stn, no pillows, no wifi, pantry was infested with rats amd cockroaches. After such a terrible experience after coming here, I hurriedly decided to move to a flat.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes, even after moving out, I kept getting invoices for next 3 months in mail. I had mailed them several times that I have moved out and want my deposit back. Worst customer care ever.<br />

Experience of tenants :  The owner is a 70+ year old man. He stays right above the home, in fact the entire building is his. He knew he was renting to a family with a small baby, but he asked us to move because the baby was crying. When I was renting, I mentioned that my brother will be moving in with us after a couple of months, but when I brother actually moved in, he had a problem with that. For staying 6 months, he charged painting charges also. When I got a wifi connection, he had a problem with that because "they will put holes in his walls".<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Painting charges<br />

Experience of tenants :  The owner lives in Dubai and has a rowdy brother in law.He is always indulgent and always giving gyan what I should do and comes at saying that the owner to the house and roams around as if it is his own flat in the name of inspection.during the time I was leaving he visited the house mutiple times in the name of inspection and in an occasion while I asked him politely not to open the cupboard because my wifes clothes were there he infomed the owner that the cupboard is broken so I am not allowing him to see. On the question of returning the deposit he mentioned the owner Natasha Desai is generous to let me stay at 20,000 pm.rent and 1lakh rupess deposit and she is losing money with only 1lakh deposit and the rent should 30,000 for a 20 yr old flat. Therefore I should not expect much return from.deposit. He threatened to throw me and my wife out of the flat just because I did not say yes to all this bullshit and told him to sleep as it was already late. This conversation happend over whatsapp where  his broker (another lady )and my wife was present in the same group.After multiple inspections he could not get avenues to deduct and made me send the house video and mutiple pictures continuing for three days. Then charged me for deep cleaning and mentioned she needs to change the taps as it has water stains.Even though during getting the house I had spent money to get the electricity boards the clothes hangar repaired I was deducted money for any small gap in switch board though in working condition.overall the mental harrasment is too much  for such an old flat which has mutiple.seepage issues.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes.discussed above<br />

Experience of tenants :  I started on 1st January 2020. The initial impression was not that great.

No disturbance from the owner at all. All are 1 bhk. Overall good experience.<br />

Experience type:Bad<br />
Experience of tenants :  The overall experience was okay but not for the rent asked by the owner, the real owner is Gali Sreejaya Dronadula who lives in Dubai (as last informed by the manager) but her father is the one staying nearby and through the manager of the apartment gets the work done.<br />
My main issue for making the experience bad is the rental agreement.<br />
As the property is on daughter's name, it should be her sign on the agreement but the father signs it and denies if asked for his daughter's signature.<br />
I did get the pan number of the real owner but I was denied for getting the rent receipts signed as well.<br />
There are 0 amenities (excluding lift and very bad power back up) and the rent charged is almost equal to many societies with a lot of amenities.<br />
The location is good but the condition of the road is so bad, forget driving, sometimes the road would be full of swamps that you can't even walk.<br />
I am not able to share this experience yet because I have not yet vacated the house and so I don't know what'll be the deposit returning situation, once I do leave this place, will make sure to share the experience accordingly.<br />
My overall review based on my experience till date is its an okay apartment but one can find a better place with good amenities justifying the cost and with real owner's sign on the agreement which is kind of the whole point of an agreement.<br />
Rent before october 2020 was 25000 and since so many people started leaving, the owner who used to be very rude when asked to not increase the rent for the following year had to reduce the rent by 2000 making my current rent as 23000, I am still mentioning the rent as 25000 because I know once things normalise, it'll be 25000 again.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Haven't vacated the flat still, so cannot say yes or no to this question<br />

Experience of tenants :  I am very happy with the owner because even he not taken any advance token money and at the time of shifting i told that my salary will come some delay so i will pay amount after 15days he was agree for that also. I paid him advance amount of money and rent after 25days of staying. And as per Bangalore culture we need to pay advance token money and some portion of deposit amount at the time of shifting. And after 11 Months due to transfer outside Bangalore he not asked to give 2-3 month's notice or any deduction of charges or painting charges. He returned my full Rs. 1 lacs deposit amount cheque same day at the time of vacate home. Nice owner i never seen in Bangalore like that owners.<br />

Experience of tenants :  The owners were mostly not interested in the apartment, until we served our notice. They felt they were entitled to us finding new flatmates for them, even though the lease had expired. They made false claims about damages and repairs and kept delaying the deposit refund. Eventually, they told us that they won't return any deposit and stopped responding. <br />

Experience of tenants :  The lady kept for maintaining the place-  fights over anything and everything . Owner's profession is raising pgs and both the lady maintaining it and owner  are money minded . <br />
If anything is not working it will take ages to repair . Food is mostly oily . <br />
Once there was bed bug issue , they got it resolved after almost a month , sleeping was so difficult in such conditions. <br />
And it's only for the location as it's close to forum mall , kormangala , Christ college that ladies stay here . <br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes , everyone had vacated the Pg and the Pg wasn't functional anymore . Due to covid I cudnot come as there was no where to live  and I was paying rent since last 6 months . So when one of my frns vacated it , I asked for deposit . The lady kept for maintaining the place started shouting on call and said she won't give money . How human is it ; I was living there for 4 years . <br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  The owner makes you add a clause that if we vacate house within 12 months then you need to pay penalty of 2 months. I had planned to stay atleast for 3 years as I moved with family and didn't care much about the clause. I visited flat many times and found it pleasant during daytime before signing the agreements. After moving  on first day itself found out why he added the clause. The flat is very close to the main road and at night you have the heavy vehiclesovinf with heavy horn sounds and noise. Couldn't sleep peacefully for even a night. On asking about it he never bothered and asked me to vacate if not interested. Since I know I was trapped I had no option to say. But once I bought my 6 month old son from native he used to cry at night due to the sounds and I had enough with this cheater and vacated paying the penalty. Later found out from neighbors that yearly atleast he have 2-3 tenants changing due to this reason and he does this on purpose of Adding clause to loot from them. Stay away from this flat. <br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes, deducted 60000 for paint and penalty charges and handed over only 40000 back<br />

Experience of tenants :  Pathetic owner. He was the land owner so got a building for himself and other wing for builders. He has sold few flats in his wing. Keeps all his and his daughter, son in law and relatives cars in this building and makes it inconvenient for renters. Asked me to pay deposit of electricity, while vacating since all other flats rent had increased as new tenants gave him more rent he was asking me to leave 2 months rent and ended up taking it. Disgusting, illiterate guy and its no use talking to him unless you have time and resources to file police complaint and have a strong support from police else they would just be on his side as you will be a non kannadiga. Pathetic. <br />

<br />
Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  Found Shwetha who is Sub-letting a room in her rented space near Kullappa Circle, in Kamanahalli Bangalore. The room was in a 2BHK, on the ground floor of a standalone building on 11th cross.<br />
I found her on nobroker, but I believe she posted ads elsewhere as well. She seemed to be a decent person at first, but her true colours came out later.<br />
On the day I was moving out, unfortunately, due to the lockdown I wasn’t there, but my friend was there to assist. At this point she prevented the movers from taking the things, and demanded that I pay 3 months additional rent (One month before I moved in, one month after I moved out, and one months rent for painting and cleaning-which was never done before I moved in). She refused to speak to me directly and blocked me on all platforms. She even refused to speak to me over my friends phone. She went on to threaten my friend and the movers that she would bring her boyfriend with the local goons to the place if I did not pay. She even told my friend that she has been staying there for the past 7 years and she knows what to do, as she has experience with people in the past. I ended up paying the additional three months rent as I had no other option, and I did not want to put my friend through any unsavory altercations.<br />
I have already lost my money to this girl, and I am here only to warn others to be aware of this person. The place will seem fine to move into, but it is a nightmare moving out.<br />
<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  There was no deposit, however demanded a lot of money while moving out which I was forced to give<br />

Experience of tenants :  The landlady and her family everyone are too good. Always helpful and reaches out to my problems. Helped me to find shops for kitchen utensils/cot during moving in. <br />

Experience of tenants :  Landlord is very greedy. He did not reduce the amount for when we were in our hometown for 8 months and when asked said we should be happy that he is not gonna increase rent after 12 months due to covid. We hardly stayed in the house but he took one month rent +maintenance for painting charges and also took extra 1000 for lights. Please do not join the apartment <br />

Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes, We Took the house during demonetisation period when cash and other transactions were limited. They took the advantage and asked deposit to be paid in cash also took the month rent in advance (pre-paid rentv) for month. While vacating they said they didn't take advance rent and we couldn't prove it because it was not online transaction. Also I was ready to give the house painted and cleaned for one more month rent amount which they were deducted but they were not ready I wonder why they didn't agree.<br />
We kept complaining about Gysers all 3 years they were not bothered but when we were leaving for 3rd grade gysers they deducted 9k.<br />

Experience type:Bad<br />
Experience of tenants :  I wish I could write the full story but it isn't in my reach. The story is from 2017 when I was laid off from my job &amp; had to start my job hunt. I went home for sometime &amp; came back to resume my job search only to find that my bike wasn't starting anymore. I thought something serious might have happened during my absence or it's just bad luck or something. Luckily the landlord's ill-tempered brother-in-law ran a garage below the house (as evident from my address over there). I had my bike checked with him. He said that there is a problem in the bike's coil-plate assembly &amp; that'd cost me upward of 1800, and additonally some 600 more to get other basic services. I neither had the money, nor the courage to spend that much. I came back home, checked for the possibility &amp; realized that either I was extremely unlucky or the guy was trying to dupe me. Months passed by. I was still jobless.  There wasn't any parking in the house. I had to park that bike everytime outside. The bike was eating dust, it's seat covered cracked because of the sun &amp; heat. I pitied its condition. I felt miserable for not being able to fix it. To add insult to injury, I lost some job opportunities because I simply couldn't afford to go to those places for a F2F interview. One day, I felt it was too much and I tried to get it checked one more time. I was unlucky once again - I did not receive any reliable assessments about what was wrong. But eventually... I got a job &amp; when the salary arrived I contacted DrivoJoy &amp; that guy.. oh my, heartiest thanks to him.. he fixed it in a second. He said.. someone had intentionally unplugged the wiring harness which was underneath the fuel tank. Few yards away, my landlord and his brother-in-law were looking at me with their mouths gaping wide in shame and horror. I knew that it had to be them. Fast forward a year and the brother-in-law had to close his bizniss (karma bro, karma) and landlord renovated that garage &amp; turned into a Condiment shop. I felt that the landlord had learnt his lesson, but no.. I had to literally beg him to refund my security deposit. It took me an ardous 7 or more months to recover the entire amount. When I look back, I feel "good riddance".<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes, the landlord deducted the nearly 30K from the 75K deposit, citing painting charges, 1 month rent (although as a diligent tenant, I had paid the last month rent too) plus extra 1 month rent just for the lulz (I dont have a better word for this). Additionally, he did not return the money at once. I had to visit him several times, like once every fortnight &amp; recovering the entire 45k or so took me about 7-9 months<br />

Experience type:Good<br />
Experience of tenants :  The house was spacious. Owner seemed peace. We were 34 students living in a 3bhk. Before moving in we asked him to get the house painted, owner asked us to get it done ourselves, he would pay the painter and deduct the money from our advance when we vacate.<br />
He never visited the house during our stay. The society was peaceful. The only thing that annoyed us mildly were the complaints. Our stay in the house got extended due to covid. We stayed for 13 months instead of 11 that we had previously agreed to. <br />
Then came the time of moving out (September end 2020). We had given a notice 1 month in advance (oral) and it was agreed that one month's rent would be deducted from the deposit. During the moving out time the owner was not easy to approach and that made us anxious. Also, we had a slight misunderstanding regarding the deposit. He insisted we had given 1L, but we actually had given 1.5L. That was cleared out by showing him the challan and other proofs. But, then he said that he would require a few more days to gives us back our deposit since he had for some reason thought that it was 1L only. Being college girls and very new to this, we were very anxious that we might get duped. Also, the owner was dodging our calls most of the time... that didnt help. We got our deposit back 20 days later. But, all is well that ends well I guess. Other than this we had no trouble with the owner.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Already explained.<br />

Experience of tenants :  Good at the time of taking for rent and advance. Horrible while returning the advance amount. Out of 1.5 lakh deposited, the owner has cut 30k in the name of painting a 2bhk apartment. Best is to avoid the home completely<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes, huge problem.  Got the advance back after 2 months after constant bickering and that too after deducting 30k.<br />

Experience type:Good<br />
Experience of tenants :  Facilities provided were not upto the mark compared to the rent. I have paid 15000 for single occupancy. Roo size is like 0.5 bhk. Had faced few difficulties during my stay. sometimes lift won't work properly internet won't work most of the time and we have to raise ticket manually. But when I vacated my room I got my advance amount back within 3 weeks without any deduction except the EB amount.Overall stay was not bad but not so good. To be honest rent paid is not worthy for the room and facilities<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  No<br />

Experience of tenants :  Owner deducted 25k overall from deposit of 130k. Rent was 18k. House was given back in excellent condition. Only repair needed was two ordinary bulb holders which were not working. I had lost a key for the main door about 3 years back so i made a duplicate key and handed over to the owner all 4 keys. But he declined to take it saying the entire lock needs to be replaced. I agreed to it. The mrp for the Godrej lock is 2k. But he deducted 5k for it including labor charges it seems. I was ok with that too. But i got very angry when he deducted 2k for two normal bulb holders and that too after staying there for more then 5 years and paying rent every month on time without a single miss. The bulb holder costs less than 50rs each and he took 2k for it <br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes. Deducted 7 thousand extra after deducting painting charges of 18k<br />

Experience type:Bad<br />
Experience of tenants :  The experience was pretty decent although we never got a pakka rent agreement because we still don't know who the owner of the house is there was a gentleman in between who works I think with the same builder. Got this flat through a broker who charged 10000. Altogether the exp was decent since we never knew who the owner was. we deposited the rent on time &amp; the owner never contacted us.<br />
 <br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yeah, He said that he will cut whitewash &amp; cleaning costs &amp; then return but the cost which he deducted for it I can get probably 5 house of that size whitewashed &amp; cleaned. <br />

Experience type:Bad<br />
Experience of tenants :  During the stay there were no issues as such. But the main problem was when we left and he held back 50% of the 2 lakh deposit.<br />
Reason - We were supposed to give him 2 months notice. I gave him only 1 month notice. So he should have deducted 1 extra month of rent, but he deducted 3 extra months because of that specific reason.<br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  Stay: When I entered, the place was ok. But now it has become very closed space, due to construction of building in front of it. It is very closed space. There are power cuts and no power back-up. There is no kaveri water. The owner charges for maintenance but there is no maintenance of the building. Landlord stays in ground floor with family. Landlord is ok, but beware of the landlady. She has a lot of problems with what you do. She wont allow to fix even a simple nail in the wall if you want to furnish something. Also, the neighboring area is not good. Very cheap people around who make it look like a slum area, and they would create nuisance and fights every other day. <br />
<br />
Deposit money: I left in August, but they have not returned my deposit money yet. Every month they say next month we will pay. Now on insisting, they are saying they will deduct 2 months rent, though in the agreement it is only one month. That too,  have been passing leads to them to get new tenant but they are very ungateful. Please dont opt for this house.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes. <br />

Experience of tenants :  The company, Your Own Room Pvt. Ltd. has levied dubious and unverified charges towards what they deem as damages to the property inspite of no such disclosure at the time of handing over the keys. They are threatening to not return the deposit money and deducting incorrect charges which do not even apply in my case. On top of that upon learning that I was in my hometown during the lockdown and that I'll vacate soon, they visited the place and without my permission opened my room to show it to new tenants. When I reached back and checked my belongings I found there to be missing items and when I confronted them about this simply denied the charges. All this after I paid the complete rent throughout the lockdown without even staying there. I was the first tenant with them and have seen them grow financially but I believe they have become worse due to such unethical practices. Now they aren't answering my calls.<br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  The owner was nosy. She used to enter the house when I wasn't home with her key. She shouted at me for not maintaining the house to her standards. She had a problem with people visiting the house. I couldn't watch a movie after 10 PM because it made a lot of "noise". She would shout if I used more water on certain days. She would also shout every Sunday morning at her son and husband which apparently was acceptable noise.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  The owner's wife who was the main problem created an issue. But her husband returned the deposit without much fuss. The lady then went on to shout at her husband in front of me for returning the deposit.<br />

Experience type:Bad<br />
Experience of tenants :  I stayed in house hardly for 3months and owner was very rubbish person in terms of electricity bills and house rent. He was putting lots of restrictions such as paying rent on exact day also electricity bill, it was quite tough for me to pay the bills on time since I wasn't at that place, also he demanded to have cash rather than online transfer. Once I put a comment as a "rent" in online transfer and he just told not to do that, also he agreed on sharing the pan details but during agreement he started saying for 11 months stay he will not share the pan, after doing lots of what's app messaging he shared a pan number not sure to whom it belongs. Overall he wasn't friendly and was trying to play mind games such as during vacating the flat I forgot the rental agreement, when I Dunzo it and requested him to handover the rental agreement then he mentioned that if I pay the electricity bill then he will handover the rental agreement to delivery partner, in response I told him that I will pay the electricity bill once he shrs pan<br />

<br />
Experience type:Good<br />
Experience of tenants :  The house is enough for one single person to stay comfortably but not enough if you want ro being friends over. Its less than 400 sq feet.<br />
The owner was very help and was living in the ground floor. Why I liked the house:<br />
1. Owner was educated and helpful<br />
2. Always approachable<br />
3. Never faced water problem<br />
4. House renr notice was mentioned in agreement but they said they won't be deducting anything extra if I dont serve notice period. And one person left after I had joined without serving notice and they only deducted one month rent.<br />
<br />
Problem started when they sold the house to someone else a year later.  These people stayed in Rajajinagar, they didn't understand English or Hindi so communication was a problem, they weren't easily approachable.<br />
(I needed the bedroom fan to be fixed and the owner said that the weather is nice you don't need fan even though I needed it!)<br />
<br />
When I found a better place I wanted to shift and I could give a month's notice.<br />
I was told all the clauses were same with the new owner.<br />
I had given 60000 in deposit and the rent was 8600. I was expecting 51400 in return. They gave me 40000 and said 11000 will be givem when they find a tenant.<br />
After 4 months , when I called them, they negotiated and said they can give 5500. <br />
<br />
So to end matters, I accepted the amount.<br />
<br />
Learning: Never assume. <br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes<br />

Experience type:Good<br />
Experience of tenants :  The experience was good overall but the house is available just through broker so you need to give one month brokerage. Rest of any issues you can call broker or caretaker or society gate and theybcome to help.Waste collection and society premise cleaning is maintained very well. Society has fingeelrprint security to enter so from safety pereepctive society is really good and located at a good place. <br />
Coming to the owner he never visited the house or met us we only talked with him on phone. During the pandemic he even reduced the rent to 30000 and at the time of vacation he deducted just 1 month as per the rent agreement nothing else and returned the even 1 day before us leaving the flat. <br />
So overall the experience was quite good<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  No issues in refund of deposit. Just one month rent was deducted as painting charges rest all we got back on day of leaving the house<br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  I paid the security deposit to the landlord while I was back in my hometown. When I reached Bangalore, to my surprise, there was already a person staying in the premises, who had no plans to move out at least for 10-15 days. Then he moved me to one of his other flats, which was pathetic in condition, with no tenants living. So I asked him to find me a decent place to stay. But as he failed to keep his side of the bargain, I served him a notice period of one month, and moved out of the flat. Shreyas not even once mentioned that he won’t be returning my security deposit or deducting a part of it, but he had no reasons to since I already served him the notice period.  <br />

Name of pg/hostel/Apartment:  L.S.Murthy's house  <br />
Address:  Behind Invogue spa and salon, 13B Main Road, 11th cross, HAL 2nd Stage, Indiranagar<br />
<br />
Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  Terrible. The owner is a decent-looking fraud and as****e named LS Murthy. My husband and I have suffered badly and I would like to warn anyone else who might take this flat up. I do not wish to defame anyone but I truly do not want anyone shifting from a different city to Bangalore suffer at the hands of this unscrupolous man and his dishonest, greedy wife!<br />
<br />
The owner is an ex-IAF officer, who behaves pleasantly in the beginning. After 5 months of stay, he started getting drunks, entering house forcibly. He asked my husband to buy alcohol for him. Because my husband did not respond to his message and refused to buy him alcohol, he asked us to vacate in a week. (He was well aware that my dad had undergone knee surgery just a week ago and was finding it difficult to walk. He started torturing and threatening only after that so that we are left with no option but to listen to him or leave the place.) He also deducted one month rent as painting charges though we stayed only 5 months, and also tortured us for the ONE and a HALF WEEKS by disconnecting electricity, sending threatening messages, and calling to hurl abuses. The broker Hyder Ali (mob # 895 191 9300) also did not help us in anything. (To me, it looked like a joint fraud by both of them considering Mr Ali kept himself away from all our fights and struggles.)<br />
<br />
Finally, Karnataka State Police came to our rescue. We have also filed a written complaint against the owner at Indiranagar Police Station (after which we could recover security deposit). For people who want more details, please DM me and I will share the complaint number and other details as required. Again as I mentioned, the post does not intend to defame anyone but just want to serve as warning for innocent people so that you do not suffer how me and my family had to and lose money to these indecent, unscrupulous people. <br />

Experience type:Best<br />
Experience of tenants :  Owner is really very kind. He picks the call whenever we had issues at home and doesn't hesitate to solve the problems faced at the house like plumbing and all immediately. Last 2 months of our stay the owner even adjusted our rent with the deposit amount. He didn't charge any extra amount other than 1 month rent and immediately returned the remaining amount within 3 days. Immediately after leaving the house the owner asked for the rental agreement and Bank account number. It was my first stay in Bangalore in an independent house and I feel lucky that I got such kind owner.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  No. Received immediately within 3 days.<br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  Worst experience till now in Bangalore. Owner promised 24/7 water and charged 1000/- extra for water but most of times we waited for upto 12 hrs for water. He is totally dependent on corporation water which comes once in two days hardly for 2 hrs. He serves same water for 4 houses including his. He has done some arrangements for water over head tanks so that he won’t get affected and only tenants suffer. He even asked us not to wash clothes more than once in a week. He took house key on pretext of repairing Geyser when I was coming to my native during lockdown but he never repaired it. He used the house for 8 months taking full rent from me.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Returned my deposit amount after lot of follow up after two months. Deducted full one month rent when actually I had used house for just 2 months and he used it for remaining months.<br />

Experience of tenants :  My review is a little mixed review. The owner was understanding. Never asked for the rent from the 1st day.  If you tell him that I have a problem and can't pay the rent this month, he would agree. But on the other very miser. The food was bad and he made it even worse during the lockdown. Preparing very little food. But he never told us to leave the PG. He told you can here because moving to hometowns will create problems. The PGs condition is very good. Clean, big rooms and big washrooms, parking etc.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  No. He managed it properly. Actually he was the one who did all calculations, informed me about it and gave me the refund.<br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  The rent charged here is 15500+electricity bill and 50000 security deposit for a unfurnished 1BHK. The owner never shared his PAN card details and he prefer cash payment. When asked about account transfer he shared his son's (20 year old) account details. Initially I was told that there will be a common washing machine, parking facility and a maid will clean the room every alternate day also uninterrupted power backup when I asked him to justify the rent. But none of them were available during the entire 15 months stay. Once you start your stay he will say that they won't allow you to park vehicles inside the building and the large gate will remain closed all the time. Hence need to park the vehicle outside the building. He is money minded. They charge one month for the painting. Also they take a lot of time to share the remaining amount. You need to follow up multiple times.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes. Had to follow up 100 times to get the money back.<br />

Experience of tenants :  The house is located in good locality. The society has unnecessarily strict charges and fines for everything under the sun. The owner lives abroad and is non interfering. Had good flatmates mostly, and co existed without creating too many issues <br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  The owner doesn't have basic compassion and is business minded. 1 flatmate vacated without following proper procedures and other 2 (including me) were left to bear the brunt. Extra deduction from deposit was done for her part. <br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  So let me start from the very beginning: When we first saw the house on nobroker it was listed for 35k. But we made a mistake and sounded desperate on the phone with the broker(nobroker agent). The owner increased the price to 40k. We negotiated ad brought it down to 39k. When we moved we made another mistake of trusting the owner and not taking a full video of the entire apartment. Bathroom tiles were dirty, cupboard are damaged, mosquito nets were totally damaged. We requested the owner a hundred times to fix the said issues. But he kept on delaying it to a point that we have to make temporary arrangement for mosquito net atleast. Rest of the things were managable by us. Next year he increased the rent to 43k(more that 10% increase). When we asked him to make a new agreement, he said you guys only make it I don't have time as if the real owners are us and not he. Then came the COVID time. In this difficult time, when our parents were facing salary cuts and we had to move to our native place, we asked him to consider reducing the rent as no was living there and it was not reasonable to pay that much huge amount for an empty flat. He said no problem you guys can reduce the maintainance charges and pay it separately to the society. When we tried to negotiate he asked us to leave in the middle of pandemic. We were three guys living inn the apartment and all the three belonged to separated cities. In that difficult time, we had no option but to leave the apartment. On top of that he said you will have to give me notice period of 45 days( the agreement was not there in place). We stopped paying him rent ad said you can cut that amount from the security deposit ad return the rest as we had a doubt that this greedy person won't spare our security deposit. We somehow vacated his place. We sent him proof of the damages that were already there in the house before we moved in(we had taken few pictures to send to owner when we were requesting him for repair). Still he deducted deep cleaning charges(tiles were dirty remember?), cupboard repair charges, new geyser installation, mosquito net repair. He didn't even give us proper bill or receipts of the service done. He just returned 14k out of 2lac rupees. <br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Most greedy owner I have ever seen. He renovatied his entire apartment with our security money. Even after requesting him a lot, he didn't listen. We produced the proofs that what all damages he is claiming were already there and we had asked him way back to repair them, even then he charged us for those damages. We could have gone to police but police in bangalore won't listen to outsiders. This incidence has made our stay and image of Bangalore pathetic. <br />

Experience type:Bad<br />
Experience of tenants :  Stayed there for 11 months from Jan 2020 to Sept 2020. No intervention with personal things.  On vacating, cut 1 month painting and one extra month from advance because I notified in on 10th of the month. The reason to say this is i was paying the rent without any delay even during the lockdown when I wasn't staying there and still he went ahead to cut 1 full month of rent, though he wasn't loosing a new tenant. The house is still vacant<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Got 22.5K of 50K that too after 2 months+ follow up. 1 month for painting ( which is okay) and 1 month for 10 days of delay in notfiying exit when there wasn't any new tenant ready to occupy the place<br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  Its like a normal PG room , has no TV facilities in any room , a bit cleaner then the rest you normally see, hot water facility is good unlike the solar heater you see most of the other PGs <br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Colive is a scam! their sales people cheat you right at the start itself by first luring you into getting a room at a low rent and deposit amount, then every month they will keep raising the rent under some pretext, its after you make the payment for rent &amp; deposit you are shown the agreement which has all kinds of unfair one sided clauses &amp; you are asked to sign this which itself is a blatant cheating since you were not informed about a rental agreement when they approached you, now you have no other option but to sign it because you have already paid the deposit &amp; a months rent money. They are the most money minded leeches I have seen yet, under some pretext they keep raising the rent, there are regular power cuts here and many times even water won't be available at the night. To use wifi you need to login by mobile OTP,  lets say there are 5 times power cut in a day which happens regularly at their stupid PG then you won't be able to use the wifi after 5th time login because there is maximum login limit!!! they never address any of such issues, there are multiple things broken in the washroom already which you will be charged at the time of leaving. For around 400 people in this PG there are 4 washing machines! and the food which is given one time in the day for a exorbitant rent is such that even dogs will refuse to eat it. Their rental agreement has a clause that last month rent won't be settled against deposit which itself is a hint to the scale of scam these scumbags are doing, once you leave their stupid PG forget getting your deposit back, infact they will further send some extra charges to you on mail saying if you don't pay them you will be sued legally, for example they charge Rs 2000 as seperation charges on leaving, this is how they harass to get every penny out of you, in hindsight I would suggest its better to live in a normal PG then in services like Colive which in the name of a descent PG service are basically organized scam, I did a big mistake by joining here. <br />

Experience type:Bad<br />
Experience of tenants :  Okayish. Landlord lives on ground floor and has rented out 6 flats in the apartment. Landlord is mostly aware of what goes on in various apartments in the building. No power backup and there is lot of power fluctuations. There is GAIL gas connection. Parking only available for single 2-wheeler, and is an issue if all the tenants are residing.<br />
Any problems in house are taken care promptly by landlord.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes. Due to covid, we had to vacate in August-end. Landlord wanted to charge 2 months rent (1 month for painting, another for leaving before 11 months). After we showed her the rental agreement, she still did not agree but at last she had to give up, still she kept additional amount for gas and electricity amount from deposit.<br />
From 70000, we got back 48000 after much negotiations (I got little lucky as my dad did the negotiations on my behalf as people listen to elders usually)<br />

<br />
Experience type:Bad<br />
Experience of tenants :  Its a standalone house in Karthik Nagar, A very good residential area with mostly independent houses and nice local market nearby with the ORR at 2mins walking distance, We moved into this house post our marriage &amp; stayed there till we left Bangalore for Hyderabad due to job changes in covid times-August 15th 2020, The owner had always been good to us ,All he wanted was to take care of the house as it was a really beautiful house &amp; we were always better than his expectations, It was a Duplex house 3bhk on each floor with independent setup on each floor, His elder daughter use to stay on the first floor &amp; we had occupied the ground floor, She wasnt very friendly on lot of grounds but I think that doesnt matter that much,moving on to more important incident, Our rent agreement had a notice period of 3 months hence on 17th of May we gave him notice that we will be vacating the house mostly by Aug mid or end at max so he can start his notice period for us now,it was done on a call as so far we never had any issues with him on any ground, post which he made a visit one day &amp; we told him in person the same thing &amp; he said he would be fine with whatever suits us but he never said that the notice period will not be counted from the middle of the month etc , Also he used to say you have maintained the house really well ,as a matter of fact we even did &amp; the house never needed a repaint but still when we were leaving he deducted 36500 for painting &amp; additional half month for the notice period shortfall hence we were charged more than 50k for what could have been easily avoided, moreoever he never told us before that he will do a repaint else we would have offered him t get that done on our own, I even told him that there is no clause in Rent agreement which says that the notice period has to be from the 1st of any month but he never accepted it, for him it was by default understood ,  Basically people change when they need to pay back &amp; after that there is no value of words or your good work! His name is Janaki Ram Gowda<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  yes , it took more than 20 days to get back the deposit, he said ill go to the house look at his condition n then decide on the amount, Also when we kept on calling him again n again to come n inspect the house till we were there he kept on making some or the other excuse , post we left he said  i will only look once i have the keys in my hand, I was very clear about handing over the keys at the moment i get my deposit back hence asked my brother to give him those in hand and get the deposit back<br />

Property provided by:  Direct owner  <br />
Name of pg/hostel/Apartment:  Viveks Sanskaar Apartment  <br />
Address:  Viveks Sanskaar Apartment, Kadugodi<br />
<br />
Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  Sharing our experience of staying at H.No. 011, Viveks Sanskaar Apartment, Belathur main Road, Kadugodi. House owners are Mamata Reddy and Praneeth Reddy. Very soft spoken when renting out and exact opposite while leaving.<br />
We paid 1,00,000 Rs as deposit money and got only 19,000 back. So that’s why house owners ask that much money as deposit, is it? We vacated the flat on 9th Jan and got this amount on 3rd Feb. They charged us as below:<br />
•	19000 - Rent of December month (OK)<br />
•	19000 - Rent of January month even though we vacated on 9th.<br />
•	18000 - Painting charges (Can anyone tell me if it really costs this much because I don’t think so)<br />
•	4000 - Cleaning Charges (Don’t know if this is fair or not)<br />
•	1000 - Removal of waste cartons (One may think this should be covered in cleaning charges, but no)<br />
•	15000 – Replacement of a couple of rusted items like hinges (I think they don’t know it can easily be cleaned by Vinegar which costs you max 100 bucks, so they want to replace them) and replacement of unaligned drawer (Because apparently you can’t repair stuff, only option is replacement) The drawer was already in bad position when we moved which turned into worse state.<br />
•	5000 – Carpenter Charges (One may think it is already covered above, but no)<br />
We haven’t received any kind of receipt for any of this. Now, this house has a lot of moisture. We had kept our luggage bags on the top cupboard, and they were not identifiable after one month. Even our furniture got rusted, but are we blaming them? <br />
She even charged us for the things which were broken before we moved in. For example – Glass of a hanging light was broken when we moved and she herself admitted that in WhatsApp, but now she is putting it on us.  I shared that chat screenshot with her, but she is still blaming us for breaking it. You can see for yourself, attaching the chat screenshots for broken chandelier and non-working light above kitchen.<br />
Few lights were missing in the house and they were mentioned in the rental agreement, so we asked her to install these lights. She said it’s about trust and we don’t need to worry. Now she charged us for that too. Sharing the pictures/chat screenshots with her was of no use. <br />
Health Faucet of one of the bathrooms was broken when we moved, and we complained but she kept delaying for months! We had to replace it with our money. She didn’t agree to adjust that amount in rent either and now she is charging us replacement charges for a little rusted tap.<br />
Ceiling of one of the bathrooms keeps leaking and we could not use it. We were paying rent of 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms, not one! I wonder why they didn’t blame us for that and added this charge too<br />
We (2 people) had stayed at this house for 1.5 years, so you can get the idea of damage/dirt that’s possible. I don’t like dirty house myself, so used to keep everything tidy. It was not our first house in Bangalore, and no one had charged us that kind of money. We had stayed at multiple houses for way longer period and we were charged one month rent as per the agreement.<br />
We missed our Badminton and Tennis Rackets while moving out and they denied finding them. <br />
Everyone deducted rent in corona times, but our kind owners increased ours, even though our salaries were reduced. They are very rich people by the way.<br />
What about the money one can save if they invest 1 Lac Rs in Mutual funds or something?<br />
She came to our house once when we had moved in for replacing an item in the kitchen. We were at office at that time but still agreed. She came with some random neighbour kids and went through our stuff. How I know – our Wi-fi was off when we had left but it was on when we came back. Later she told us that some neighbour kids came with her, they were watching our TV and played with our pillows. Wow!<br />
<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes, returned only 19k out of 1 Lac<br />

Experience type:Good<br />
Experience of tenants :  The land lady on most part was a non-intruding lady. The house itself is quite old but well maintained. But required some repair works. To get those done, there was always some push back and there would be delays. But eventually she would see reason. She helped by lending her old sofa, study table and bed. The house has very few electrical points so do stock up on extension boards. There is no power back. And water can be an issue some times. The neighbours are also very sweet and helpful. Generally a great location to stay in.<br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  This room is on the terrace. it has a hall with a kitchen platform and small bedroom. The terreace has good plants. that's where the good stuff ends. The land lady stays below this floor and she would be extremely nosy. She would have a problem with me taking baths in the night cause the sound of water would disturb her apparently. You couldn't walk on the terrace after 7 cause again the sound of the foot steps would disturb her ! she had a problem with anybody coming to visit - girls and boys. Even delivery boys. The worst experience ever.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes!! the lady asked me to vacate the house in a month's time. After finding  a new place, a week before moving i told her to keep the deposit ready and she said she will give it the day i am shifting. The night before her son and another friend of theirs came knocking asking why i am moving. And they need more notice and that they can't pay. and they will pay after 1 month and some bull shit. The son and his friends were literally like goodas. their languageof and manner of speaking was disgusting. I had to call the cops to make sure they return my deposit money. <br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  I was given the house on rent after being recently renovated. However, after moving I realized that the work was not complete and the owner had rented it out in order to get easy money despite the house not being in good living conditions. There was no gate attached which was a big security risk for me living as a girl alone (later my parents came to stay with me ). There was no main door added either . only a grill from which everything inside the home was visible. The entrance to my ground floor was used as a dumping ground for construction material. There were several times i was unable to open the main grill of the house because of it being blocked.<br />
The bathrooms frequently got clogged due to poor quality of construction. Backyard was dark and full of construction materials from the owner which he refused to remove. <br />
Throughout my stay , the construction work was ongoing and there was excessive noise and dust pollution causing migraine and dust allergy. My aged parengs got sick again and again due to this.<br />
Worst experience ever.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes. When we gave notice period 2 months early, he insisted that for a month atleast we pay half the rent (instead of cutting from deposit). Ultimately out of the 25,500 i was due, he gave me only 5 k back giving some stupid logic .<br />

Experience type:Best<br />
Experience of tenants :  I had this apartment from August 2019 to mid Jan 2021 and have had the best experience. it was very well furnished, had spacious rooms with attached washrooms. All appliances came with the house (except washing machine, which we bought off the previous tenants and have now sold to tenants who came after us). And contrary to what has been said, by some misguided soul, about the landlady of this house, she and her husband are actually very sweet and genuine people. If they were the problematic ones, we wouldn't have renewed our lease for another year in 2020. They upgraded our fridge and even put in an extra couch mid-contract, which they absolutely did not have to do. During covid they also slashed the rent by 10k for us when asked them to consider it. When we first moved in they allowed us a weeks time to pinpoint issues in the house that they got fixed using the previous tenant's deposit. Same was the case when I and my flatmate moved out(we vacated because of extended work from home). Landlady got the house deep cleaned for incoming tenants and resolved all their issues that stemmed from damages we had done( couple of lights were replaced and sockets were repaired). We were in contact with the incoming tenants throughout the transition and all transactions were completely transparent. It has been over a month now since I have moved out and am finally writing this experience so that others may find it useful. I would personally love to get this house again if I ever get the chance.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  No issues. Deposit was returned in a timely fashion without any undue charges.<br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  I have to shift the house on immediate basis so I found this property on magic bricks.  Later I contacted the person he himself introduced as a manager of the building. Here the series of lie started. The house has no power back up, no ventilation no shops nearby basically a retarded area. Where you will hardly find a peaceful sleep. I have visited once so was not able to check the area much. But I have investigated with the manager of the building (which later found to be the owner). There was no power back up. No electric meter, no proper water supply. And many more things. As he told with a month he will be doing all the above things.  Now he doesn't pick the calls. He misbehave and he used to give his phone to his daughter. And he is tourturing day by day. Manner less fellow. I am looking for 1 bhk as soon as to shift. As currently I don't have the opt but just to tolerate. Need a serious help. I am in doubg weather he will give my deposit back or not. Please guide and help me.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Currently in place. But in doubg if he will refund.<br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  Bad experience, very greedy owner.<br />
This was during covid pandemic. We saw the house in March and wanted to shift in April. He forced us to move in March or else he would not give us the house at all. We were naive ans thought he is doing it for 1 month rent. After this lockdown happened and we had to move back to our hometown and we never lived in the house. We asked him to reduce rent but he said no and asked he will throw our stuff out. He took advantage of us being at home and covid scare. We gave him the home in this original condition after contract ended because we didn't even unpack our bags.we lived there only in Feb 2021, whilebwe were looking for new place. And he said is deducting 1 month of rent still and he is postponing even that everyday with some excuse.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes, he deducted from deposit even when we didn't live in the house and there was nothing damaged or done. Plus we had to do deep cleaning immediately after taking the house. Even after we agreed to deduction he is not giving back deposit. He is extending for no reason<br />

Experience type:Bad<br />
Experience of tenants :  The PG was really good at first, clean and with wonderful owners. Starting December 2016. Later after a few months the owners were changed ( they were original owners’ brother and SIL) . All problems started then. The land lady was very cruel and rude. Would never listen to the problems, sometimes even threatened to leave immediately if we had any issue. The food was the worst with new owners. They wouldn’t even pay the cook their salary. Neither would they recharge the TV connection for months ( even for the TV room). People started to leave the PG with the owners . Wifi was just for the namesake. No one would stay for more than 2 months (even I left then).<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  The owner declined the deposit at first( didn’t say much since it was a small amount) then after little convincing he agreed<br />

Experience of tenants :  Overall a good house with furniture that included sofa, dining, cot, mattresses, curtains and a washing machine. Has a lift and power backup and uninterrupted water supply caretaker is very helpful. The house is nearly 8-9 years old and that can be seen in the furniture, fixtures, cupboards. Fixtures like door handles started to break or become lose and kitchen cupboards made of MDF have started to erode gum pasting was coming apart tiles are pitted. While vacating we were charged for Hangers -6, 1200rs, Basket plate-4 rs1600, channels-2 rs600, chimney cleaning for Rs1500 kitchen dont remember the chimney to be Rs1500 level clean when we had come in and also so many fixture repairs that had a age of 8-9 years were being replaced using the deposit money. Bedroom cupboards  channels 580, door handle 600/ Toilet: glass hinges 3500 which had rusted before we occupied the house, geezers repair 2500 (we had already repaired it twice once it was installed wrongly thus warranty was void then had to pay for the heating coil for 2 geysers, after a year again the coils got spoilt and had to be replaced 2400 already spent by us) washing machine service for 1200. In total 15,000 got deducted additional to one month's rent.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  They were charging us 17,600.00 additional, finally settled for 15K after 2 months.<br />

Experience type:Bad<br />
Experience of tenants :  The house hadn’t been painted or maintained in 6-7 years despite the owner and 3 other tenants having lived in it. During the stay, when we asked for house painting, he asked us to pay for it and when we said it hadn’t been painted for this long, he lied that it was 2 years ago. 1) I checked with the previous tenants and all confirmed that it was never painted and those arbitrary colours always existed. 2) While we pushed for the inspection when moving-in, the owner’s broker didn’t document it, and at the time of leaving, the owner deducted money for structural issues as well as for all historical repairs. 3) We had negotiated down our rent escalation after 1-year. This was mutually agreed between both parties. When leaving, the owner deducted the differential of what he expected and what we had agreed at the time of renewal. <br />
<br />
We threatened the owner with a legal notice and that’s when he refunded the amount on structural repairs. He didn’t refund anything else and since we had already relocated to UK, we found it difficult to pursue as he lives in US and his family in Mumbai. <br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes. Explained above<br />

Experience of tenants :  Stay was average, rent and deposit both were too high in compared to other standalone buildings. There was water leaking issue from the ceiling of bathroom which owner never fixed. Too much crowded locality.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Owner is like a goon now a days, not returning 1 lac security money. Promised me as within one month he will be returning the deposit. Now it is almost 4 months, he is delaying day by day. Not picking up calls and sometimes behaves aggressively. I would recommend never to get into any property of this owner. <br />

Experience type:Bad<br />
Experience of tenants :  Located in HRBR Layout which is a nice area overall. But this particular house is next to an abandoned bungalow which is filled with garbage. I have seen a few reptiles and rats coming out of there. <br />
<br />
Speaking of house, the living room and small bedroom gets a bit of sunshine but master bedroom and kitchen are always in dark and need to keep the lights on all day. Bathroom door in master bedroom was broken and toilet seat in other bathroom was broken too. Owner repaired it after requesting multiple times. Bathroom fittings and electricity switches were old and never repaired when I came to stay. I had to spend nearly 7k in repairs over 2 years of stay. <br />
<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  <br />
I have paid 1 lac 30 thousand as security deposit. I have vacated the house on December 2020 after serving 1 month notice period. With 20000 as painting charges + 20000 for December rent + approx 3000 in pending water and water meter charges deduction, owner has to return 87000 rupees. It's been 3 months since I vacated the house but still have not received the deposit back.<br />

<br />
Experience type:Bad<br />
Experience of tenants :  Bad experience.<br />
<br />
- Owner does not accept rent online (netbanking / UPI/ GPay / PayTM), insists on giving cash only. You have to pay cash in advance  if you're going away for few months<br />
- Owner does not give rental receipts nor PAN card for availing HRA<br />
- Cockroach infestation is rampant especially in kitchen due to poor planning/construction (kitchen window is right next to drainage pipe). I've got pest control done from my own expenses half a dozen times but problem is still present<br />
- Owner's mother lives on ground floor and is quite grumpy and rude, does not even allow visitors park their bikes within the building for even one hour<br />
- Neighbor buildings are quite closely situated so frequent noise present. A married couple living in next building keep fighting all the time and create huge ruckus and disturb everyone in the neighborhood<br />
- No power backup and frequent power cuts during summer<br />
- Roads in the area are dirty and in horrible condition with constant digging / construction going on. <br />
- Garbage disposal is a huge problem, garbage vehicle comes anytime they want with no fixed hours so you'll have to keep waiting. If you have to go to office in the morning you are screwed.<br />
- The road is quite narrow, so even 2 wheeler parking is difficult<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes, quite some issues:<br />
- In addition to deducting painting charges, owner deducted 1 month rent additionally<br />
- Owner made me replace the faulty electrical bulbs with my own money then charged me extra again for electrical repair work<br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  My stay here was without hassles. But the owner denied the refund of deposit completely on vacating the property. The owner's behaviour was rude and I am cheated of whole 70000 rupees I paid as deposit.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  I initially got this house through Furnome which was a third party which sublet the house on behalf of the owner. Thr rent was 19500 including maintenance and the deposit paid was 70000. Around March 2020 Furnome merged with Grexter and I started paying rent to them. Till now no issues. Cut to October 2020, I got a mail from the owner of the building Mr Bharath saying Furnome/Grexter has handed over the building back to him due to issues unknown and that I will have to pay the rent to him. When asked about the deposit amount he said he will take care of the deposit and refund it back when we vacate. The pandemic was in full swing and I was in my hometown since June but was still paying full rent. I talked to the owner that I will be vacating the flat because the full rent wasn't feasible for me to pay as I wasn't staying there anyway. He said he would reduce the rent and 14000 was the new negotiated rent. Now I got married and the moved back to Bangalore in February 2021 and thr place seemed too small for 2 of us. So I gave the owner notice to vacate the flat on 14th February. He said I will have to serve the notice till March end becuase he wouldn't get any tenant mid month. This was weird as my initial rental agreement mentioned only 1 month notice. When asked when he would refund my deposit he said 1 week after I vacate. I vacated the flat on 1st April and gave back the all the keys to the flat on 2nd April. 1 set of keys was already with him since 15 March for prospective tenants to see the flat. After 10 days of chasing him for the deposit he said he owes me nothing as:<br />
1. He only is responsible for 60% of the deposit becuase Furnome/Grexter still owe him lot of money.<br />
2. From the 60% after deducting the "discount" from the rent paid since October to March there is nothing left to pay from the deposit I paid. <br />
<br />
Thing to note here is 14k is near about the rent he is charging the new tenants now as post Covid rents have come down drastically everywhere. <br />
I still have the mail where he said he would take care of the deposit amount and never it was mentioned in writing or anyway that he would deduct the anything from the deposit on account of the negotiated rent. <br />
<br />
This guy is lying through his teeth now. If I had vacated the flat in October last year, given the pandemic situation he wouldnt have got any tenants for the flat. The negotiated rent was win win situation for both of us. Now this guy is acting as if he showed me mercy and did me a huge favour. When indeed what he did was cheating me of 70k. <br />

Any issue regarding deposit refund:  My roommate and I vacated our flat (797, 2nd main road, AECS 'C' Block in Brookefield) on the 24th April and went back to our respective hometown. I had informed the owner about this and had told him to settle the deposit amount by 23rd itself. But on the 23rd when we were trying to hand over the keys and wanted to settle the amount, he was just trying to escape the whole situation and after a heated argument of phone told us that he would return the amount by 24th evening. Although he lived in the same building, he refused to meet in person and didn't even return back home that night. <br />
Its 26th now and he has switched off his cell phone and blocked our numbers. He instantly blocks whenever we try to call him from a new number. <br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  The Owner is worst , While I wanted a flat on urgent basis’ since I was shifting from Pune. I saw this flat and once I visited the flat had Seepage issues. The owner promised me that he will do the repairing work before I moved in. After staying 3-4 months also the work was not done and situation became worst. At last I had to request the society chairman and under his intervention the work was done , that after hearing lot of abuses from him. <br />
The Owner Abhishek will never abide by his promises and always he himself contradicts his statements. <br />
<br />
He is the worst owner I hv ever faced. In the month of April ‘ I told him that I’ll leave the flat in June (giving 3months ‘ notice ) , he agreed to it. After few days he called and asked if you can vacate the flat in 1st week of May. I told him give me sometime to work out my dates and then I’ll inform. <br />
<br />
I confirmed him that yes’ I can leave the flat in April itself and I have booked the packers &amp; movers . At this point he backed out and said , this is too early I won’t get tenant so early n all. At that point I told him are you crazy ‘ you only told to vacate in May and now you are saying No.<br />
<br />
I didn’t wanted to argue’ so I told fine you deduct May rent from my deposit. <br />
<br />
Till now I hvnt received anything ! And I know he will do the same with others. I have many other things to say. But cannot write much. If any1 wants to know the reality please call me at 9777660584<br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  One of the costliest compared to the space provided. Has very low wattage connection due to which you can't install AC, no maintenance of the building or lift, owner Krishna is money minded.<br />
<br />
I used to stay in this property and took 1bhk for 13k. Post lockdown he increased the rent to 15k quoting there is heavy usage of electricity and water during lockdown. As i didn't had option, agreed to live there for sometime. Post lockdown lifted, i vacated the property but then he deducted 13k for painting charges although it can't be that much cost for a single BHK. Also it took 3 months for him to return the deoosit. Never stay there. <br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes, had to wait for 3 months. Also deducted a months charge from the deposit although it wasn't part of agreement. He mentioned its common practice in Bengaluru <br />

Experience type:Good<br />
Experience of tenants :  Experience in terms of owner is best. The guy is genuine and cares about you a lot if you are cooperative. An example was that when I moved in, it was quite rusty and dirty. But the owner booked the Urban Company Cleaning thing and he got it all setup. So these gestures indicate the guy listen to your problems and he tries to solve it immediately. In terms of locality, there was construction happening so it was quite noisy but now it is okay. It was on the ground floor so naturally it was bound to be less ventilated and in terms of sunlight. It was well furnished and the quality of stuff was 4/5. <br />

Experience of tenants :  She is old woman(45-55age group) we respected her. Whatever she has asked to pay her other bills like electrical and water bills we had payed, she told we will adjust in the next month rent. She did no doubt.<br />
<br />
But we informed her one month prior tht we are leaving your flat she started giving others bills we thought in last it all going to be sorted out and she said so too.<br />
<br />
But pandemic period had just started and she had refused to come to meet us(totally fine she is an old woman and at that time was more risk to that group of age) and give us our deposit back. Not expected full but some amount.<br />
<br />
We have called her several time she has not responded. once she had respond was then she said ``she cant help us one the deposit she dont have any calculation on that now" and she hanged up and  never attended our cal since.<br />
<br />
Though it was like 15k from the deposit that we expect at least to be recover after one month rent deduction + bills we had paid 4k approx. Total 19k.<br />
<br />
Never go for this landlord. Total thug. She is very convincing buy her talks. She is not that poor or needy. she is a government official retired and lives in some Prestige apartment. Her name is Saroj.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes, after vacant the house, We have called her several time she has not responded. once she had respond was then she said ``she cant help us one the deposit she dont have any calculation on that now" and she hanged up and  never attended our cal since.<br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  House was specious compared to other bangalore apratment, but see my experience regarding refund of deposit and association of society which is not good.<br />
Landlord will seem friendly when you rent, you will get to know him at the time of vacating.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  I will share my experience in details, bear with me. Owner stays in US and he has some local relative in bangalore who manages the house.<br />
Apartment was rented in august 2017 and while renting also in agreement it was mentioned while leaving the apartment deposit will be returned fully if apartment is in good condition apart from normal wear and tear. FYI we didn't renew the rent agreement which already expired in july 2018.<br />
In march 2020 covid started in India and we were in bangalore only and stuck there only(see my comment regarding association why i used the word stuck). In may (2020) last week every body returned to their home. We were paying full rent till august 2020 and owner agreed to reduce the rent from September only that also he was charging 15000 which is also too much when nobody is staying. Then again 4 months passed and we realized that paying 15000 each month does not make sense when our company also extended the home work home. Then we informed the owner at the starting of january that we will be vacating the house in january 2021 end. Then he was like you just pay 6000 per month and stay. This is situation when we told we are vacating but that didn't work for us and as it was still not making sense to pay rent for nothing and some of us already booked the ticket for Bangalore to vacate the flat. Then we went and did the cleaning of house by paying 1500 and vacated the flat.<br />
Then comes the time of refund of deposit, the owner was constantly delaying, we were following up regularly. Then on march first week he deducted a sum of 35000 saying some random painting/cleaning/fixes. Despite the house was cleaned by us, there was nothing to fix and paining was also not required in hall, only rooms and kitchen was sufficient. We asked for bills also, but he didn't provide any bills.<br />

Experience of tenants :  The owner was as unacceptable as his wife and his employees. He would barge in the rooms and even if you block him from entering he will go straight to bathroom in the pretext of checking for leaks. His wife would stare at you and every girl who does not speak the same language. The cook guy locked me in my room once, I called the owner and asked him to immediately open my door latch but he was comforting me saying it is just fun, when I threatened to inform the police the cook came and opened the door and said i got latched in due to wind. FYI, anyone who has lived in a pg, at least in Bangalore knows there is no air in the corridors, forget about cyclonic wind to magically lock a door from outside. He also used to check out girls openly and comment in Telegu. Overall a very dangerous pg to live in. It has several buildings now around Kundalahalli signal, please ask anyone you know to vacate the pg immediately. Other pgs I have heard are still better than this one. Maybe if you are a Telegu, you might have a pleasant stay.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes, gave notice in time, still no refund, excuse given was I had exchaged a mattress that had bed bugs.<br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  The owner lives downstairs and she wanted to always check on us and she wouldn't allow us to live peacefully, for example after 10.30 pmwe couldn't even speak we had to whisper. She throw us out of the house for no reason and  she wanted to cut 1.1 lacks from the advance (house rent was 29,000 per month). There were not damage in the house and only painting had to be done, only for painting she wanted to charge 75,000 while the previous tenant, who I know, paid just 25,000 before us. She wanted us to repair some damage in the kitchen that the house had already when we moved in (I have pictures as proof, but she didn't care), she accused us to squat her house because we were not living whe per contract she had to give 1 month notice. We had to call the cops and she tried to tell to them we had drugs in the house (which cops could see was not true). At the end we had to sort the issue living the same day we called the cops in just 6 hours (5 days before the date agreed) when pur new house was not even ready and paid 50,000. We tried also to call the painter who did the house when we enter and he gave estimation of 37,000 bit they wanted us forcefully to use her friend who quoted 75,000 for painting and 35,000 for damages that were already in the house. Thanks to cops we could get our money back also if 50,000 was still overcharged. <br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes, we had to call cops because they wanted to overcharge us<br />

Experience of tenants :  The landlord is the rude and a cheat. A fraud lady who charges too much from bachelors and family and fake promises of building utilities like full time power backup, regular cleaning and full security. The service providers PropUrban are also cheat. Many tenants have lost their full deposit which is over 50-60K. They promise that the deposit will be returned within 10 business days, but many of the tenants who have vacated the flat haven't received it the deposit even after 1 year of vacating. They give the covid situation as the pity excuse, and some of their agents used to collect rent from the tenants directly and stole the entire money. The Amitha charges too much of electricity bill, the individual tenants doesn't get the bill to their names, and split the amount herself charging way too much than the actual BESCOM rate. I would strongly request others not to fall pray of the fake promises of PropUrban or Amitha Reddy the owner of the Janani Residency property.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes, the deposit is not returned back by the owner or PropUrban agency<br />

Experience type:Bad<br />
Experience of tenants :  Stay was good, no issues till we stayed there. Actual owners are really good in nature and very helpful. They had given that building om lease to PropUrban who was managing all the services. There was no issue till the time we stayed there.<br />
<br />
Issue started when we vacated the flat amd asked for deposit amount. They have not yet returned the deposit amount (more than 6 months). I checked with owner and it seems PropUrban did some sort of fraud with the owners as well. He shared few more contacts from PropUrban but of now use. <br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes, its been more than 6 months I am following up with PropUrban but everytime these guys says we are checking with financial team we have not heard back from them yet.<br />

Experience of tenants :  In the beginning owner was super sweet and Owner shown his real face while leaving the flat. Initially he was not returning our deposit but there following him for 3 - 4 days he return partially. According  to agreement he has to deduct 1 month rent amount as a painting charge but he deducted 2 months of rent amount , when we asked why? Then he was like painting charges are increased in 1 year of time. Worst owner....Idiot<br />

Experience of tenants :  House is nice and well ventilated with 3 bed rooms, hall, kitchen, 2 bathrooms(one attached), 1 main balcony and a utility space/balcony. The building had lift, power backup and security guard for 24hrs<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  No problems. Initially we asked the landlord to deduct the last two month’s rent from the deposit as we were sure that we would leave the premise at the end of Feb,21. The rest of the money - the charges was given to us by cheque the day we vacated the premise. <br />
It should be noted that we had done deep cleaning and fixed a few basic fittings throughout the house that we thought had been broken by us(cost us about 11k in total). Despite that the owner wanted to change a few bath and toilet fittings for which we had to share the costs! <br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  While I lived in the house, it's been okay. As soon as I notified them about vacating the flat, they became Vindictive.<br />
Also, a few months back there was issues with the Geyser and The hand Shower and their pipes were required to be changed. It costed around 1k in total and I transferred them 500 Rs. Less as part of that month's rent. They called me out for it and made me pay the remaining 500 as well. They told that such replacements need to be borne by you.<br />
I didn't Question much as it was a matter of 500 rs. and I could afford it.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Dear Team,<br />
<br />
I hope you're keeping safe in these tough times. Actually I'm having some trouble with my owners, hendlcd thought to seek help here in this group..<br />
<br />
I'm listing the issues that I'm facing with my owners as follows. Please help me if possible.<br />
<br />
1. It's a 1BHK apartment and in the name of furnishings, A semi automatic washing machine, fridge, TV, Bed, Mattress, Geyser, TV cabinet, bedroom cupboards and modular kitchen has been provided.<br />
2. My Rental agreement expires on 31st May 2021 and I'll be vacating this apartment by the end of the June. Owner has 1+ month of notice that I'll be vacating their flat.<br />
3. I've paid a deposit of 1 lac for this apartment and my Rent per month is 18k.<br />
4. Owner behaved very vindictively after coming to know about me vacating the flat. She asked me to send pictures of each and every item, which I did. Afterwards she called me on WhatsApp and said- Sofa has a stain and it's of no use for me anymore, I'll be discarding it and will be charging 25k for it from your deposit. The dining table chairs have stains and they're of no use either anymore, without the chairs, the table is of no use either, hence the whole dining set also I'll discard and that amounts to 20k which I'll be deducting from your deposit. Apart from this, 18k as one month's rent for painting and cleaning charges.<br />
5. I asked her to adjust my June's rent in the deposit money itself, but on top of the 1 lac of deposit, she wants me to pay her an extra 18k for June's rent and says it can't be adjusted from your deposit.<br />
<br />
It's a clear case of extorting money. The stains that she is talking about can be easily deep cleaned by Urbanclap Homes  services. Also, I checked the price of the dining set and the 3 seater sofa on homecenter and they amount to 7.9k and 16.9k respectively.<br />
<br />
I'd request you to please help me, or please get some help, if possible. Please let me know if you need anymore information from me regarding this issue.<br />

Experience of tenants :  We moved into this house during pandamic..we were living in the same society in another block and had an amazing owner who waited out till we found a good place but coz of covid and budget issues and not finding a third roomate we were not getting much leads. This owner srinivas was in touch with my roomate pre pandemic but we weren’t a fan of the place. He still kept in touch as he was in US and had no one locally to help. We finally had no option and  agreed. He asked a million questions and took so many documents including passport which made no sense. We overlooked it at first assuming it was his paranoia. Then we got to know that he had spoken to the current tenent at length about us which again we understood. When we saw the house right before we decided to move we told him the house needed painting and deep cleaning, a bunch of boys had stayed there for 5years and the place was in not such good shape. He wasn’t happy with the idea. He asked the ex-tenant to book it up coz it would be deducted from his deposit and fix the electricals. We had to physically coordinate the painting after the tenant left and also the cleaning done by him was a poor job and we asked to be done professionally. We were paying good money for the place which at that point was the same as our old place which was very well done. He was unhappy. Also when I saw the rent agreement it wasn’t his name on it but his FIL in chennai, he was pissed when asked and after a back and forth he sent a deed in his wife’s name. So we asked his where abouts, his address and work location onpy to find he was currently unemployed. It was very suspicious. He insisted we transfer deposite ie 1lac a week in advance before we move in we didnt get it. Also the agreement said 2months notice and when insisted he said it’s just written as formality and he’s never had anyone read the agreement for real and we were just making a deal about it. I really tried to push but at that point my roomate just said he has agreed to not take the 3rd person rent till we find one so let it go. I was uncomfortable.<br />
As we moved in our transport guy ran away on us, the building manger of the new building offered help @4pm and said he’ll talk to the RWA to extend the moving time. His boys came at 5pm and we were no just loaded with 80% stuff by 6pm when he called and told us we can’t move that day as it’s out of moving ours. Our beds were dismantled, it was peak covid and our stuff was all in the truck, we were stranded. We asked the owner to call the RWA but they didn’t budge. We lived in the next block 500m away but we spent the night on the floor. To worse it all next day was sunday and Myknos building didnt permit to move then. We managed somehow until monday. When we move in monday a lot of things were not working including the sink drainage, geyser leaked, gas stove, no gas pipe to the modular kitchen, lights weren’t working, it wasn’t a liveable place, didn’t work properly etc. we had given the visible list before we came in and the ones we discovered we fixed it all on day one. We sent the bills for reimbursement to the owner. He hammered us on the expense and claiming why we didn’t buy it off Amazon. No one buys gas related stuff off amazon in india, we said we did our best. The thing was the last tenant never reported any issues and the boys that lived for the last 5years avoided communication coz he was a meddler. When we told him the boys have left the house in bad shape he asked us to leave. We were tired of the bickering and honestly unnecessary building rules. We thought he wouldn’t react this way, so we started looking for another place in a weeks time. He first asked us to leave in a few days and when asked about deposite he said he can only give after 2months + 1month as per agreement (yeah that was another clause, deposite return 1 month after leaving which again he refused to budge) we thought that what of this jobless guy never pays..how will we find him in US. We were told to keep staying rent free without paying rent till we use up 1lac but he started asking rent end of the month. We couldn’t hold to stay in the house which we never got to unpack in and looked for places tirelessly..finally when it seemed liked nothing was working we decided to sell all our stuff and move back to our parent (not the best decision for long term) but we were left with no option and no mental energy. We stayed 1 month..paid rent for two months and got deposit back after 3 months. The worst decision of our life. Luckily we didn’t have to pay 3 people’s rent for the period of stay but that guy was hell rude and the society folks horrible even when it came to rules, the were bias and unapologetic in covid times.<br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  It started with the owner invading my privacy to show the property to families. Then I was asked how much rent I was paying randomly in the parking lot twice by the owners parents as if I wasn't paying enough. When I shared this with nestaway area manager, he proceeded to give me Gandhian gyan instead speaking to the owner. The people nestaway has hired are generally goons and come and go as they please without prior notice. My roommate has lost her phone due to this. <br />
<br />
They levied irrelevant fines I've paid atleast 25k in fines and to top this deposit was never returned. As if this wasn't enough Nestaway has sent me legal notice for amount that isn't due. <br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  It was not returned<br />

Experience of tenants :  The flat was so dirty when we saw the place.. We agreed to move and we had to deep clean the house while we entered. The landlord(Dr A K Pujahari) agreed at that time but deducted various unreasonable charges(deep cleaning charges, painting charges, repairs) while we moved out from the security deposit. It was not mentioned in the agreement and the landlord refused it outright. Very arrogant, greedy and deducted 40 thousand from the security deposit.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  The agreement did not mention about the painting charges. But, the flat owner deducted money for painting charges, deep cleaning, electricity repairs, plumbing repairs. Very arrogant and money minded.<br />

Experience type:Best<br />
Experience of tenants :  House was nice and every year increase in rent was 5% as usual, there was proper maintenance of building by owner, best part is the owner is very nice she doesn't care how many people are staying in house, since I was bachelor and we were 2 friends staying there and sometime my friends used to come from my native or from other city I never informed her like how many friends are coming for how many days and she never asked also. so I never felt like I was staying in a rented house and and at the time of vacating house she refunded me whatever was reasonable of my deposit, since I shifted to a 3 bhk house in a apartment and the owner is very bad which I will definitely give full details once I will get back my security amount (discussion is going on now) since I came back to native due to lockdown. <br />

Experience of tenants :  We stayed for 10 months there, we payed full deposit and payed rent on time but suddenly after 9 months he asked us to vacate the place with in 10 days, he mentioned there is a family emergency. We didn't wanted to trouble him so we agreed. On last day he was supposed to come for settlement but he started making excuses, he said there is a medical emergency so he can't come and will do settlement by tomorrow. After that he started making excuses everytime we call, it went on for 10 months. Once we suddenly dropped at his place, and confronted him then he gave us a weird bill saying he had to replace toilet fan etc etc so he will be deducting from the deposit. He was supposed to return 92k deposit but he only returned 50k.<br />

<br />
Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  We took a fairly new semi-furnished house that had a few issues as following:<br />
1. Geyser issue<br />
2. A few chipped walls in the master bedroom<br />
3. Fan regulator issue<br />
4. Scratches on dining table. <br />
<br />
But, as the owners resided below they assured us to get the regulator and geyser issue fixed in a few months. 2 years passed but they still did not get it fixed. <br />
After the completion of the 1st year they increased the rent by 5% despite government advise on rent freeze during the COVID period from March 2020 to sept 2020. We still managed to pay the rent on time for the next one year more until in 2021 they increased the rent by 10% again. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, they had started construction of another house from December 2020 which continues even till now that is June 2021. Due to the construction, our personal area-the balcony was completely useless as the house was more like a penthouse. They continued the construction despite lockdown or covid surge in cases exposing us daily to the risk of contamination, as the construction was being done just on top of our house with the workers accessing our balcony and personal space on a daily basis. <br />
<br />
When we raised concerns, we were shot down saying that construction is crucial. As tenants we did not have much say so we endured. <br />
<br />
But finally in May when we informed them about our relocation and that we would be vacating by June putting a month's notice, they began to act out. <br />
<br />
During possession, the owners had claimed that the total rent of Rs 26250 was inclusive of electricity and maintenance (mind you it's not a society so maintenance only includes cleaning but the househelp was only provided in 2021 that too on and off. )<br />
<br />
Finally, after vacating and constant delays in paying the deposit back, we decided to instead deduct may and June rent out of it and they agreed. Post that, around Rs 42,500 was left with them which they assured they will return after deducting painting charges and other damages. <br />
<br />
But after vacating they made a long list of unreasonable costs like mattress stitching, ambiguous carpentry work, lamination change, sanitization (although we sanitized and cleaned the house before leaving), curtain charges (never ever used the curtains as we put up our own), etc....creating a bill of some Rs60,000... <br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes. They did not pay it back and made up unreasonable charges<br />

Experience type:Best<br />
Experience of tenants :  Its been more than 2 years since i moved to this place. This was something that hit close to home. the owners are super nice and responsible. They never interfered once. Till now for any repairs or anything done in the house they havnt charged us a dime. they just pay once in a while visit just to check that everything is fine. If you tell them that for some reason the rent would be delayed they actually understand and dont make a fuss about it. its been a very good experience for us<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  still living at the place<br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  It was a 3 BHK, three individuals shared three different rooms, when anyone left a single room he used to arrange replacements. Over the course of 2 years two individuals left the house and were replaced. Owner deducted 10,000 from each of the two individuals. When COVID 19 broke out we decided that we will leave the house. Upon leaving owner deducted 62,000 from the advance along with the 20,000 that was taken from the earlier two individuals. Owner is an habitual offender of not returning advance. So we told him that we would return the keys only after taking the advance. To avoid this he gave us a cheque and then cancelled it when we were about to encash. Owner's wife is very very abusive and rude. She used to curse and speak very badly and rudely to us.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  80,000 worth deposit not returned<br />

Experience of tenants :  I have not unpacked my luggage from the last 11 months.  Waiting for the 11 months agreement to finish. So that I can leave. Soon after shifting here I realized this society doesn't have any mobile network. Serious network issue. When I informed this to the owner he said ,he was not aware of it. And was extremely rude and rough with me  told me to vacate the house the very next day of my shifting. That was soo heartbreaking.  I felt as shifting with a truck full of things and then unpackacking is just a joke for him. I was alone with my 6 year child.  The struggle, abuse over call was never ending for two days  he threatened me that he will cut the electricity.  He gave two options to me.  Immediately vacate the house if I feel network issue is a big problem for me. But have to pay cleaning charges and one month rent. Orelse stay without complaint. Told its not owners responsible to tell that there is a serious network issue here. That I.should have enquired.  Now additional broadband connection I had to take paying monthly 1000 rs.. After continuous fight threats over calls and mail finally he agreed to include the internet connection in the rent.i thought anyways things going to be ok. I agreed and Immediately he came from electronic city to take the advance 75k. He took the money on the same day and gave agreement.  But for my surprise after the advance us taken. For every pity issue he start insulting me to vacate the house.  This dialouge he started repeating in all his calls and messeges.  For instance if there is any flush leakage issue.  I asked him for repair he will get very angry and tell that's not his responsibility.  Literally say me to vacate Immediately.  This full flat doesn't have a single nail to hand a clock.  I asked him to put atleast one nail to hand a clock.  He never replied for it.There are lots of issues in the flat but I'm scared to inform him as all my mails he replies very rudely. Tells me to vacate.<br />
Finally I'm in the last 11th month. He has increased the rent for the next agreement.  I lost job six month back. .<br />
Going to vacate  <br />
My experience was the last 11 months I stayed here with all packed things. Even furniture are sealed packed not opened.  All cartons are ready to pick and move. As anytime anything can happen.i feel from my heart"THAT FINALY ITS ALL ABOUT MONEY"🙏<br />

Experience of tenants :  The best landlord on the planet! Our landlord's name is Beena Reddy and her son Kushal Reddy and they're probably the kindest people on the planet. We started renting in 2015 and till 2021 they've not come even once! They agreed to let us paint and renovate the house according to our wish, and during the pandemic, due to too much pressure and stress, we forgot to pay rent for 3 months. Instead of lashing out at us, Beena called us to find out if we needed anything. She's the best landlord anyone would be lucky to have! <br />

<br />
Experience type:Bad<br />
Experience of tenants :  The owner still belives after leaving house if he misses rent for few month before new tenant comes it's old tenants responsibility. It should not be like that. One can move in or move out any time with notice periods &amp; prior intimations.<br />
<br />
Also, He took 2 days extra rent while I moved in on 3rd of April, 2020. I gave notice period mid of month, total 1.5 month notice, still he deducted 15 days extra rent while moving out. Total he charged 17 days extra rent from deposit. I have requested him if can to not deduct unnecessary extra days rent as I had huge financial loss, but he kept arguing saying I am not deducting painting changes &amp; all. It was cleared before moving only that for short period no painting charges , only for long term &amp; if painting is required, he will deduct money.But he gave such excuses saying all Banglore owners do this. Also kept giving excuses all Bangalore owners return deposit only when they get new tenant, he will take from them &amp; give to old tenant. <br />
<br />
This mentality of people (where owner believe leaving tenant has to get them new tenants so that they don't miss on rents while transition, waiting charges has to be paid, returning deposit only they should do when they get deposit from new tenants)should be stopped &amp; corrected, so I have added review here. All these nonsense mentality has to be removed from roots in Bangalore owner - tenancy structures. If you take this house any time please be clear about this points with owner &amp; try to mention in Agreement.<br />
<br />
It was 2.5 BHK &amp; guest room which I occupied, but he says it 3 BHK. After moving in you realise it is just a very small room &amp; charged 10K inclusive of all charges is also higher rate for that room. Bathroom is also shared with other room, so 10K rent is completely unreasonable price. I had urgency so I ended up paying 10K for it, but other should be thoughtful about this too.<br />
<br />
Also, 0.5 room's door lock was not proper. when I told him to repair it, he didn't. I had to stay in hall for 2 days as it was getting locked from outside itself, without any key, if it gets closed by mistake. But as I thought I won't stay there longer I stopped wasting energy to ask him for repair again &amp; again. The room also don't have any cupboard locks. Even though room &amp; cupboards are closed it gets tons of dust inside cupboards.<br />
<br />
Overall owner seem genuine but while moving out he gave unwanted excuses like all other owners, disappointed. He was comparing his goodness with other owners in Bangalore &amp; excusing. I should tell he gave urban clap cleaning service for sofa &amp; kitchen as he told. <br />
<br />
Hard water / tanker water - Huge hair fall problem<br />
<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  I gave 1.5 month notice, I had to vacant after one month - 15 days early, but he argued comparing himself with other Bangalore owners &amp; other rules owners have made &amp; following themselves. He threatened he is gonna loose august month rent or so, all owners give deposit back when they get from new tenants only, painting charges was not required but still threatened saying I am not deducting any painting charges too like others do, He deducted total 17 days extra rent. At last returned deposit after end of 1 month notice instead of 1.5 month but deducted all half month rent as well.<br />

In 2021 when my flatmate moved back and I wasn't finding anyone to move in, owner reduced rent to a beatable amount as long as I didn't sublet it or another person didn't stay for a long time as a tenant. Very understanding. No interference. <br />

Experience type:Best<br />
Experience of tenants :  The best option for low budget. No poking of landlord or caretaker in any matter. Friendly behaviour. Deposit money also not much compared to high end apartments. 2016 it was 20k (3 month rent) still bit high. It is 30-40k now. They negotiate sometimes. Overall pleasant experience. They are going to charge painting ones while leaving, but looking at carpet area it is not the 1 month rent and would be less.<br />
<br />
Compact house, <br />
24 hr water - no charges extra<br />
Geeser <br />
No power backup - not much power failure.<br />
Caretakers staying nearby and available 24/7<br />
Since rent is low, so cosmetic things like switch board damage, geezer not working etc to be rectified by tenant.<br />
<br />
Good exp.<br />

Experience type:Bad<br />
Experience of tenants :  The landlord lives in US and doesn’t want to spend a single penny or effort in the house - not even for painting and repairs. He only wants rent and when you reach out for major repairs, he will just pass it on to the tenant. This was despite us writing in the contract that anything above 500/- would be owner’s responsibility (I’m from real estate industry). At the time of renewal, the owner agreed for less increase of rent as the market had gone down but later deducted that money from our deposit. He also listed a lot of issues to make further deductions from our deposit. We couldn’t have retained the keys as we were relocating to UK, and the owner was aware. Not a good experience overall. <br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  The landlord never inspected the premises himself before other tenants and depended on the broker. The broker’s agent changed during the stay and didn’t do the handover. While we maintained the premises better than what we had received (I’ve a cleanliness and perfection OCD), the landlord deducted the deposit for all the repairs of the house in the last 5 years - we had only stayed for 2 years. This included structural defects too that the broker also insisted was common across the apartment complex. We finally threatened with a legal notice, and some part was refunded while the other wasn’t. <br />

<br />
Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  The outlook of the house is very nice. But things are not done properly. There was wiring issue due to which many of our devices were damaged.The chambers will overflow during rain like anything. Owners themselves will throw things in drainage and chambers will be blocked. Backside they will you throw water from terrace which will be blocked and that side comes the kitchen dining and puja room wall which will damp. Water will go every now and then due to non maintenance of storage tank. Neighbour is very dangerous. Will keep on disturbing with noise and  owner's kid will ride cycle throw things on floor which will distyrb you the whole time. Overall it just look good from outside but living there and experiencing the things will just take the peace off. <br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes. Owner is very greedy. He had not returned the amount stating that kitchen cabinets are damaged due to termite from the back side which is attached to the wall which cant be noticed until you detach the whole cabinet  and he has to change it and rest for cleaning and painting. <br />

Experience of tenants :  It is at wonderful location, issue is no roads, you will face challenge in online delivery, calling cabs. Good thing is landlord is accomodating. He asked only 2 months of deposit in 2017. He takes care of home maintainance. Tap change, small thing repairs and never asked us to pay. Issue is you can not play music at home. Even slightest noise is not ok.  Garbage is not cleared daily and owner lives on first floor. But he is not nosy. We did not faced any challenge with him. He is supportive. There was time when we didn't paid rent for one month because of financial problem. He understood that as well. We wanted to move to bigger home so leaving now. But if you are moving with family and do not like loud music. This home is for you. <br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  We are leaving on 5th August. Cannot say now<br />

Experience of tenants :  There’s a girl called Varsha and Her dad Vijay Gowda who claim to be the owner of the house but later you find out that they are just subletting it . They create contracts to siphon off money from people . They have done it to tenants before me and now after as well. They don’t let people leave by giving a notice period . They put the condition of finding a replacement or keep paying the rent . <br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes, they deducted 30k from my account saying that they need to hire a broker to find my replacement. <br />

Experience of tenants :  While staying, most of things were okay except repair of any damages and owned used to delay the maintenance payment to society. He used to take the rent inclusive of maintenance from us.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes, I still did not get the full refund of the deposit. At the time of leaving the owner has deducted 1 month rent (as per agreement) + 3500 maintenance (not as per agreement) and took the keys (one of my biggest mistake) saying that he will refund the deposit money within a week. He did not give any money after a week and asking for some time. After a month he return 25000 of remaining deposit of 80000- 21000 = 59000.  34000 were still remaining. Its been almost an year and till now after multiple follow ups he has refunded 10000 more and 24000 are still with them. They never pick up call and are very bad people. <br />

Experience type:Bad<br />
Experience of tenants :  House owner only takes rent in cash or cheque. This has caused massive headache for us when we shifted during the pandemic. House owner calls every months and disturbs for rent. You will only be able to communicate properly with them if you speak telugu. House has a very small entrance door. No parking. No dustbins provided for proper waste management. No proper place to keep own garbage bins as well. Owner says house is semi furnished but has nothing apart from geyser, lights and fans and 2 very flimsy cupboards. During vacating the owner deducted 6K extra over the painting charges which is one month's rent i.e. 22K. Even asks for electricity for 15 days even after deducting 6K extra in the name of maintainance. House is very basic and not at all worth the rent being asked for.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Deducted 6K extra up and above one month's rent as maintainance. Even asking them for multiple times not to deduct the extra amount during covid they deducted 22K as painting charges and 6K as maintainance for cleaning.<br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  We rented this apartment a year back and the owner didnt do any pest control or deep.cleaning.he only did regular cleaning and used some disinfectant in the kitchen when we informed again and again about cleaning and other pests at home. He also didnt paint the house before giving it to us. The house is very well used and old and you can see that in the bathroom and utility area etc. From the first day onward owner was in denial of everything and kept saying he has cleaned the home and done the pest control etc even though we sent him.photos. looking at his careless behaviour towards all our concerns in the beginning only I told him that we dont want to live here and we are leaving. That day he had come to our home for the first time since we rented his house and did some minor fixing of curtain rods. Thinking of the hassle and everything to move again we decided not to leave. When the time came to renew the debt agreement I told him not to mention any clause of painting charges since he didnt paint it either. He told me he spoke to us last year also and he will look at the house condition and then decide. I told him its not fair. You didnt clean the house or did pest control or paint then why should we pay while leaving. Intact I had paid from my pocket for kitchen cleaning from urban clap.he said we can mutually compromise and talk about the painting charges. I told him there is nithung mutual. From the first day itself its only the tenants who are compromising.Today he barged into our hosue without informing us when only my mom and my younger brother were at home. He started picking on petty things like why there is so much dust at home and why there are cockroaches at home. I reminded him that cockroaches were there when we moved to this house and we informed you about it. You didnt do anything about it. He is asking why the kitchen chimney is not cleaned when.he himself didnt clean it and he has some unrealistic expectations to keep the house crystal clean at all given point of time. The main reason.behind all the nagging and petttness was that fact that I asked him to remove the painting charges clause. He is also extremely sexist because he never wanted to deal with me since I am a girl and when he had come to our home during the initial days he made a very sexist remark quoting his wife and saying females generally take tension for smallest of the things. He also have the habit of sending vendors like plumbers etc to check the hosue without any prior notice. Last time even though I told his wife to inform us they still sent somene last moment. I.would suggest to rent.this apartment only if you are willing to.compromise and lose money. I am highly doubtful if he will give us our deposit also. <br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  We are on notice period now but I am sure we will face issues <br />

Experience type:Bad<br />
Experience of tenants :  Owner was a miser. Whatever we told her to fix, she would say the problem was not there before and hint that we caused it. For inspection of those problems she would come unannounced (which was clearly mentioned in the contract that she won't enter the house without informing before). Because she didn't plan and come, she has unapologetically disrupted my meetings (I was working from home), and talked loudly when I was in one. But I'd like to add my shortcomings as well. When I had vacated I didn't remove the papers from the common area(I had forgotten those), the rest of the stuff was taken by my friends in the coming weeks because I was in a hurry. But she went there the day I left, clicked pictures of whatever was left and kept sending those even after they were taken away by my friends. I was so confused because on one side she was sending me these pictures and on other side they were saying they disposed it or got it disposed. Also there were a few chalk marks on the wardrobe. They could be removed easily but she took 500 extra from me for that and the amount of bullshit she created for those was annoying at best. She's a petty person. I had come to know later from one of the neighbours that even the previous tenants had a similar fight with her. She had one positive: she reduced our rent from total 50k to 44k because of COVID, making my rent equal to 11.15k from 12.65k<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes. She gave me my deposit after 2 months of my departure.<br />

Experience of tenants :  The location worked for me because it was close to my office and pretty much every thing was nearby. Later I got frustrated because of the traffic and pollution. However the owner was not interfering and always relplied to me politely whenever I faced any issue. Effectively I stayed there for 15 months. Rest was lockdown when I moved to my hometown. The good part was he returned my deposit after deducting one month rent just after I vacated. I also did not pay the last month rent just to be safe and he didn't object. <br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  No it was very smooth. He returned immediately after I vacated. Deducted one month deposit as per agreement. <br />

Experience of tenants :  I shared the place with two of my guy friends and the owner had no problem letting two guys stay with a girl (shocking coz every apartment we checked had a problem with this situation). When covid happened and one of my friends lost a job, left the town it was difficult to manage rent. After discussing with the owner he reduced the rent from 14k to 10k. We gave him one month notice and the day we were vacating he handed over 22k of the deposit (14k for painting and 14k the rent of last month we stayed, it was stay and then pay policy)<br />

Experience of tenants :  No issues from society, owner was extremely polite and good. We forgot to take 2k back which he had kept as security till he got the keys back. During pandemic it took time to reach the keys and we forgot about the 2k. He himself messaged after 2 days and paid back the amount. No useless deduction from deposit and quick transfer. <br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  Well, I am giving my personal account of genuine experience of the matter, if you are new to the city  it might be of help. This landlord has the worst behaviour I have ever seen. When you meet the landlord for the first time, they do buttering and make a warm welcome. This is for temporary. Once you pay the advance, it's done. Landlord will be behind your back and starts interfering in almost everything. Continuously asking to clean here and there, which is already clean. And also if you want to wash your vehicle, here it is not possible because tap is locked and they won't allow it. And at the beginning they say you can use terrace to dry the clothes. After few days they say, someone has destroyed our plants and we don't allow anyone there. Coming to house, it's a 2BHK house, where you can see old electrical appliances, it is not checked when the previous tenant checks out the house. It's given same, and if you face any problems in between, they ask you to pay penalty for it and for sure it will be more than the cost of repair. If any problems occur, they are not ready to fix it. They just ignore. You need to keep lights on for whole day because house is too dark and there is no proper ventilation. Unwanted blaming keeps on going, which make the tenant irritated. Coming to kitchen, there is no proper space to keep your utensils and there is no utensils storage space is given. You need to buy separate utensils stand for that. You need to keep washing machine in bathroom, which is already small in size. And always there is water problem. Automatic water pump is not switched on, even though it is there. You need to wait for hours, to get water. And when you are leaving the house,  you can expect for a big fight. Apart from deducting painting charges and rental bill, they deduct extra 2k-5k for cleaning bathroom and floor which is not at all mentioned in the agreement. And talking about our characters and involving into our personal life. One funny thing is involving kids for the fight. This was very clear how parents teach their kids to behave in front of elders. So we could clearly understand overall behaviour is not at all good. Better not to choose this place and be careful. This is the genuine experience I can share.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes.. they deducted 15k for painting as well as 2k extra for bathroom cleaning. Extra 2k deduction was not mentioned in agreement<br />

Experience of tenants :  Owner is arrogant and money sucker. He never spent money on house and rented out to multiple girls for more than 10 years. Told us to pay for painting and fitting charges during our stay and confirmed to give back our full deposit as he already charged for it. Was v uncooperative when we left around April in Covid times and left us hanging for multiple months without any response. Finally he responded saying us demeaning things and cut almost double the amount written in rental agreement. He is a bully. <br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes multiple follow ups and pleading for deposit fetched us our deposit after months with huge reasonable deductions<br />

<br />
Experience type:Good<br />
Experience of tenants :  Pros: A decent 2BHK for reasonable rent in a good locality.<br />
Owner himself doesn't charge more than 2 months rent as deposit, you don't even have to negotiate it. <br />
The groceries, milk, and drinking water can is readily available just downstairs. <br />
The furnishing is as good as new. The place has a good ambiance.<br />
24 H water supply. Cauvery connection so no need of tankers and stuff. <br />
In terms of Internet, Airtel works fine here in terms of Cellular network and HS broadband/Fiber services.<br />
Notice Period is of 1 month. <br />
<br />
Disadvantages<br />
Owner still deducts one month rent as painting charges. <br />
The security of the building is a concern and the maintenance guy comes once in a week for cleaning common areas. He is responsive if there is any issue and he did repairs for us but there is no security guard and regular maintenance is not happening.<br />
If you are a family of more than two people, the space will be a little congested. It is 850 sq. ft. Area.<br />
Parking is only for a two wheeler. If you have a car you have to park outside. <br />
<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Nope. It has been adjusted in rent.<br />

Experience type:Bad<br />
Experience of tenants :  I have stayed there for 5 months and I have kept the house neat and clean. Not even a single scratch anywhere. Still he deducted 1 month painting Charge and 1 month rent as penalty for leaving before 11 months. Also, he deducted 1000 extra for throwing 5 Cardboard boxes which was the only leftover there.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Unnecessary deduction and he will not pick up your call initially unless you become arrogant and give threat to legal proceedings. Though he is a coward but very cunning and will make agreement to Harrase you.<br />

<br />
Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  The society overall is good and well-maintained. However, one big issue is that there is no power backup.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  The owner, Anil, took 1 year to return the deposit. He deducted a lot of unnecessary charges from the deposit (electrical fittings, labour charges, bothroom repair etc.) I had to come back from my home town (Jharkhand) to Bangalore to get back my deposit, as he was not responding to my calls and messages. He has 16-18 flats in the same apartment and apparently lots of his tenants met with the same fate of not getting deposit money back. The owner used abusive languages couple of times. He is not afraid of legal proceedings. He is already not paying maintenance to the society, and so the society association have filed case against him. He had even kept tenants' maintenance money to himself instead of paying to the society due to which the society association stopped all the services for tenants as well. Everyone in the society seemed to hate him.<br />

Experience of tenants :  Appreciation for Best Landlord : Mr and Mrs Akshay Madikar <br />
<br />
We were lucky to have made a friend rather than a landlord, in the form of Mr Akshay. He went out of India and surrendered his house with complete trust to us, 3 years back. He never complained or he didn't even come to check his house conditions even when he was back in India on a visit. Anytime we informed of any small repair issues within the house, he never hesitated to pay for the repair. <br />
In all these years, we have made a good friend with a big heart. We will miss staying in his house which is going on rent from Sept 16th onwards. <br />

Experience of tenants :  We vacated the house last July and we informed the broker that we have vacated for which he said that you don’t have to pay the rent. When you come back here then you will pay normally. We never knew who the owner was. After we came back in December, we paid our rent normally and in August, the owner calls me out of nowhere and said to pay the last year 5 months rent. I told him that we were informed that we don’t have to pay anything for which he said he doesn’t want to hear anything and he won’t leave a single penny and he will take up the whole security in the process. I told him that I am not in the situation to pay because I don’t earn that much right now. The only reason why we left last year was because we were having problems during Covid. There is a constant problem of electricity cut and water cut in this house and the rent is very big in comparison to the bad situation in this house for the basic necessities. He told me that in that case when I can’t pay him then he will take up the whole security and he asked me to vacate the house. I vacated the house this month and he said that if I don’t pay him the painting charges and this month rent which is 50,000 then he will file a police case against me and will go to court. The man has been constantly harassing me for something which was never my fault. I only did that because I was told that by the broker and the owner harassed me for that. The house is very bad. There are problems for basic necessities like water and electricity and the owner is a very bad man. He is a complete fraud. Adding to this, when I met the broker, I asked him who the owner is then he said she is an old woman but now I get to know that it is a man who is a fraud and harasses his tenants.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  The owner has taken up all of my deposit and is harassing me to pay the rent which the broker told me not to pay. I am not in the situation to pay and it is wrong to ask him after one year for money like this. I am in trauma since a month because of my owner’s attitude towards me.<br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  Before we started to live in that house, owner assured there will be no water shortage, but as we started living, from the 1st day, no water was coming in any of our taps in the room, no water in washrooms and kitchen. We asked the owner, he replied back with a humiliating words and started abusing us physically. He mentioned, that we can leave the house if we are not OK, but he will not pay back the deposit amount. At that point, we were not earning much, so we decided to stay there till the agreement ends. We bought 2 75 liter storage drums for our water usage, owner used to run the pump to get water once in 2 days. Whenever he used to run the pump, we start filling our storage drums. This way we managed with water. There were times, when there was no water supply from owner for consecutive 4 days, in that case, we had to buy 20 Liter gallons. At last when the agreement ended, suddenly owner did not provied water for the whole week, we spend our money to get water from outside. We charged back the owner, but the owner was not there in his house at that moment, his brother came out started hitting us, we did not stopped and started hitting him back. After all this nuisance ended, owner came up to our room with local goons and started charging us, abusing us physically and verbally and asked us the leave the house by 2 days, otherwise he will use his goons for throwing us out of the flat. He also mentioned, if we go to Police, it will be of no use, as he has strong rapo with all the Police of Bangalore, and Police will always listen what he will say. So without any hesitation, we moved out of the flat within 2 days and shifted to a PG.  But the owner did not gave back the deposit amount. <br />
Also, Everytime we paid the rent and paid deposit, owner always asked for cash and always denied of any sort of online payment. Very sure, owner is playing with the tax payment regarding the residency.<br />
<br />
Owner name is Suresh. <br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes, owner did not refunded us the deposit Amount<br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  The owner and his wife were rude. The house had many issues from the beginning - there's been leaks in the wall and plumbing issues. Painting started chipping off two days after moving in. The wardrobe isn't functioning, the paint is scrapping off and they are blaming the tenant for it. They ring the bell unannounced and then yell why didn't you open the door. They expect you to be free whenever they are free to get the repairs fixed. Even the agreement clauses weren't discussed prior and i was tricked with a new one as opposed to the one i was showed. I regret moving here and this has been a nightmare one after the other. I had even informed the owner i will have visitors and he shouted at me saying i reduced the rent for you and now everyday there's a man in the house. Which is not true i live alone and only a friend visits and he made it sound like someone is living here. I am not comfortable with him and his men doing the house work here while i was alone so i asked my friend to be here and he made it sound like something so nasty. This is so hurtful. They dont like it when we question and even asked me to leave if i am not comfortable. After investing so much on moving i cant believe it. Bangalore owners are the worst except a handful of them maybe only if you are lucky. <br />

Experience of tenants :  Appreciation for Best Landlord : Mr and Mrs Akshay Madikar <br />
<br />
We were lucky to have made a friend rather than a landlord, in the form of Mr Akshay. He went out of India and surrendered his house with complete trust to us, 3 years back. He never complained or he didn't even come to check his house conditions even when he was back in India on a visit. Anytime we informed of any small repair issues within the house, he never hesitated to pay for the repair. <br />
In all these years, we have made a good friend with a big heart. We will miss staying in his house which is going on rent from Sept 16th onwards. <br />

Experience of tenants :  The owners track the activities of you and you guests through cameras all the time.As per their unsaid policies,guests are not allowed to stay even for a day and if they do they start harrassing for money.They will harass for money apart from your rent if there is a guest coming over to your 1bhk apart from the you (single stay).They will harass for money if there is maintainance issue,when the maintainance is already included in the rent.They harass for money , for DTH and electricity citing stupid reasons,when all these expenses are included in the rent.At the time of vacating the premises,the security made our video without information. They don't allow any house help or cook coming in the building from outside and force you to take help only from the security staying at the premises even if you are not good with their work.The services are zero and 10000 unsaid restrictions and money extortion methods which are not mentioned before your move in.They block a property of your choice but the day you move in with your stuff,all you get to know is that property you paid for is no more available they can move you to another flat of a completely different layout.Once you move in no matter how many times you ask for the rental agreement they will not provide you and ultimately will come up with another method of money extortion by asked 4 times the security amount you paid in order to have the rental agreement.Please don't expect your deposit back.Moreover the owners doesn't know how to handle their tenants all they know is to harass<br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  Had stayed in the house for only 3 months during lockdown (2nd wave), had to vacate the flat due to money minded owner. She literally forced me out. Did not give my deposit for good 10days after vacating. I had found her new tenants as she requested me "Please see to it that I dont face any losses". Out of good will I found her new tenants, got the house repaired and deep cleaned, where as I had just moved in and the house was already in mint condition. Yet I got it deep cleaned before leaving. The owner made me literally beg for my own money back, never responded to my calls or msgs after I handed over the keys to new tenants. Deducted unreasonable amount from my deposit. <br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes, had to literally beg her for my money back. She gave multiple timelines that she would refund it on. On the day of the refund would not answer calls or msgs. If I continued to call her would ask for unreasonable declarations at 12am in night. So she does not have to pay my deposit. Would make commitments that "as soon as I get this declaration I'll send you the amount ". The same cycle repeated multiple times. Every time a new excuse.<br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  Unprofessional, Greedy and inhumane Landlords. House is good<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  yes faced a lot of difficulties in this regard only. Initially Landlord Daughter and Mother were extremely nice . As soon I gave them Notice about vacating, their Greedy and inhumane behavior came out. I had to suddenly leave for hometown because mother was diagnosed with Cancer and a lot of money was needed. <br />
I managed this vacating my house from remote somehow. Instead of supporting this , she straightaway started pushing me to get the apartment de-cluttered (after Shipping People left, minor cleaning was required). She was pushing me to handover as soon as I shipped the item. It was 21st. As per agreement, it was supposed to be 31st Aug as Handover day. <br />
Landlord kept on delaying the discussion with me regarding one month deduction clause mentioned in the Agreement until 28th.<br />
I even checked the quotation for painting and Quotation from NoBroker.in which came out to be 13K only. NoBroker Guy checked the condition, he said single coat is enough as the apartment is in good condition.<br />
She completely denied about this and told me she would deduct One Month's Rent.<br />
Till this point was okay as it was mentioned in the agreement.<br />
But she didn't let the housekeeping people of the society clean the apartment on 31st as well as 1st of this month. Although she charged the Rent till 4th of this month.<br />
Apart from One Month's Rent , she asked 5000 for cleaning. <br />
As this was the 11th Month, agreement was about to expire on 31st Aug. Still she deducted 4 days rent as written Notice was sent on 4th Aug. Although the 30 days notice was for terminating the agreement before 11 months.<br />
She included CLEANING into DAMAGES category. This cleaning which she didn't let me/housekeeping persons.<br />
She even deducted money for ASD(Security Deposit) of electricity which she paid earlier.<br />
She was completely aware that from outside Bengaluru, I cannot file police complaint neither can I start any legal proceedings.<br />
She deducted 7700 additional to 17500 of monthly rent from my Deposit which is illegal of her to do it.<br />
<br />
She is not rationale and doesn't care about logic and truth. She was dictating terms as she had my money. I pray no one should ever go through all this.<br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  Worst experience. Deducted 52 thousand from deposit stating that the washrooms are dirty and everything needs replacement instead of simply cleaning the washrooms. We do agree though that the washrooms were dirty but could've been cleaned easily. <br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  only 10% of the deposit refunded. Owner says that since we left the bathrooms uncleaned he had to get the tiles and pots replaces. He basically conned us to get his washroom renewed. The owner did not provide any receipts to prove that the repair work was done so could be possible that he did not get anything repaired/replaced and just took the money.<br />

Experience of tenants :  From the beginning everything was clear. Owner stays in US and house was shown by the current tenant. The society is right on the main road with good amenities.

Owner promptly returned the deposit within a week. <br />

Experience type:Bad<br />
Experience of tenants :  The information about the house provided were vague (like what all is there in terms of semi furnished), extremely ill maintained house - every other day some or the other problem like rats, electrical issues, plumbing issues, non responding and unavailable owner, so everything came on tenants' (me who is new to the house) shoulders.<br />
<br />
So I decided to move out within one month itself - of the 2 months, 1 month was my notice period which I gave considering to be reasonable to the owner<br />
<br />
<br />
Voila, when the time to pay back my deposit came - same old tune of maintainence charges, painting charges etc he deducted, and now he's not even answering my calls<br />
<br />
<br />
He has 4 to 5 flats in Prakruthi Paradise under the name of KV Reddy (Krishitish Vardhan) <br />
<br />
His phone number: 9972409995<br />
<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes, as explained above, he deducted painting and maintenance charges - - I just stayed there for a month, and 1 more as a notice period... What painting, what maintenance??<br />
<br />
I didn't get my deposit back (16k) and now he's not answering my calls<br />

<br />
Owners Name - Sudharshan.<br />
Agreement will be on the Name Sudharshan/Kamala.<br />
<br />
I lived there for 2+ years, Everything was so smooth till the moment i had decided to move out and informed the same.<br />
<br />
The rental agreement had expired in March, it was not renewed by the owner and i too never asked for it as I knew that would be moving out soon.<br />
<br />
Evert month before 5th, the same amount of rent had been transferred mentioned from the agreement.<br />
<br />
Post handing over the keys and paying the latest electricity bill, upon asking my deposit for 10days, the answer i got is, i still owe him money. This is from the same man who had agreed to transfer the remaining amount the day I had handed over the keys. <br />
<br />
Calculations goes like, 10% of the rent had been increased like mentioned in the last year's agreement from March 2021, he never had this point till now while charging the rent....And the repairs which were existing from the last two years, before my tenure were charged for me.<br />
<br />
I can keep on writing, wouldn't want to waste more of my energy.<br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  Before renting the house, I had told owner everything clearly that I will stay with my brother and our friends will come sometime. He had no issues with bachelors at that time but suddenly after moving in, he started creating trouble for us though for the entire period of stay, we never partied, never played loud music, never created nuisance for anyone. Apparently he had problems with people coming up and down after 10pm because of footsteps. He gave 2nd floor on rent and there was no lift so obviously when we climb stairs there will be minimum sound of footstep. I went to talk to owner to sort out things but he said he doesn't have nay problem with us and after few days he asked us to vacate his place without even giving 2months notice which was mentioned in the contract. <br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes, I kept asking about the refund and asked the owner to return it before we vacate the flat but he completely ignored and told he will return it only after we vacate. We then told that we will not vacate if you don't return the deposit, after that on the day of vacating, after we removed our stuff from the house then he returned the deposit after deductions. He should not have deducted because he only asked us to vacate and we didn't even line there for an year plus we kept the house in excellent condition.<br />

Experience of tenants :  Owner cut 2 month's rent from deposit for no fault of ours, including 14 extra days since we submitted the keys late as well due to lockdown as well as maintenance charges. House should not be rented under any circumstances. At first owner is well behaved, towards the end she becomes very rude. Since she is an NRI, she has no idea about ground reality. House has two bathrooms. In one room, she has kept a cupboard with her own belongings which eats into the space. Society cuts water at night to save water, even supply to bathroom is cut.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  2 months deposit cut for all silly reasons, including damage to bathrooms because of fluoride water which was not our fault.<br />

Name of pg/hostel/Apartment:  Adarsh Palm Retreat  <br />
Address:  near RMZ Ecoworld , Bellandur<br />
<br />
Experience type:Bad<br />
Experience of tenants :  The company Your Own Room would not readily agree for any repair work and had to be pushed hard for structural issues as well. On top of it while vacating due to the pandemic and me being stuck in a different city, they opened the room without my permission for showcasing to other tenants, and have committed theft of certain items. When confronted, they denied and asked for proof which of course was not there due to no cameras inside the house. Highly pathetic behaviour during the leaving process as well with charges being levied for no reason.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes, I was charged for the cost of chairs, and other furniture which were easily repairable and I should have been charged only the repair cost which was peanuts. On top of that there was no return of deposit money for 4 months after which I had to threaten with judicial action . <br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  During the initial discussion owner told he will clean the property but after I transfered the deposit he told you clean the house and did not bother about anything so I did as I have already transferred the amount.<br />
He also promised to put a cupboard but when I came back from.natibe and nothing was arranged and at that time had a fight over the phone then he placed the cupboards after some days. <br />
At the time of vacating I have given proper notice of 1 month and now it's being 1 month  (15oct2021) I have vacated the house he has not given the  deposit. Very worst experience with this guy<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes I have not received the deposit yet it's being 1 month I have vacated the flat. Owner is still making stories and not willing to give the deposit back.<br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  House was overall good, when we moved in some kitchen fittings were not upto the mark ( like loose handle ) and we asked him to repair and he confirmed he will but he didnt but we managed as we liked the house too much. Things started turning bad when we asked him to sign agreement.<br />
- Even after taking 1.5Lac as security he asked for rent of the month before living itself.  (in whole bangalore that is not the rule)<br />
- 11 months passsed and I never delayed a single rent.<br />
- after lease expired, I reminded him that our lease is expired and then he blamed us only that we are living "Illegally". <br />
- We renewed the lease and even whole bangalore increase rent by 5% this guys wanted "7+"<br />
- Whenever owner get a chance he will make you feel that he doing a big favor for us for letting us the house. Also will remind you that he is the owner and he can do anything.<br />
- For every small/big repair I did, he never bothered to pay or reimbure those.<br />
- When we decided to move out after 3 years.. even if whole bangalore has 1month notice this guy wanted two months notice and no relaxation for vacating early as well. <br />
- Please be aware this guy will show you he is very good and all but once you move in he will show true colors.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes, we faced a lot of issues.. <br />
Right thing to do is to return our deposit the day we handover the keys and vacate.. but he asked for a month after vacating. and that too required continous followups, he never used to pick our calls or reply message<br />
from 1.5lac he calculated a bill of 90K in which he took 2 months of rent + painting + all possible kind of repairs(including wear/tear).. he even repaced coil of perfectly working geysers . he kept delyaing the deposit. only when we told him that we will take action he paid.<br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  I have horrible neighbours here who've put false complaints on us and because of that the owner wants to include these clauses in the agreement.<br />

We shall renew the lease agreement with the following new additional conditions:<br />
<br />
1.	No smoking is permitted within the premises.<br />
2.	No person other that the tenant/s shall stay overnight , except with the prior written permission of the landlord.<br />
<br />
*Any violation thereof that is brought to the knowledge of the landlord shall entitle the landlord, at his sole discretion, to (a) terminate the lease with 1 month notice to vacate and/or (b) forfeiture of the security deposit. The tenant agrees that the landlord’s decision in this regard shall be final and binding on the tenant.*<br />
<br />
And the owner wants to increase just my rent by 5000 more than what everyone else is paying. <br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  The worst ever flatmates ever possible. The primary tenant Mellisa is a spiteful woman who is extremely dictatorial about how she wants the house to be maintained. She is very rude and entitled and treats all the flatmates like sh*t. Her and another flatmate get into fights especially during working hours and put music on high volumes which is disturbing and frankly hazardous to ears. Absolutely toxic kind of environment to live in, with the worst of flatmates. To top it of, it is managed by nestaway. enough said!<br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  Very good till the end. Owner did not give back anything from the 1 lakh deposit. She used it to repaint the whole house once we vacated , repair few things which was not our fault. We did not even get the house repainted. She charged 10000 for just cleaning. Instead of sharing the cost of maintenance of the house, she charged us the whole thing and is now asking 50000 more. Whole time we stayed there she never came to check her property. Least bothered. Total cost of all the repair including painting would jot have been more than 40000. <br />

Experience type:Good<br />
Experience of tenants :  Really great and helpful owner. Property managed by renteasy not so much helpful. Since its fully furnished and used some of the furnishings are in not such a good condition. Be sure to take details of each and every small thing that is not perfect at the time of moving in. We were not given serviced electrical furnishings or washed mattresses but at the time of moveout were charged for the same because we didn't raise at the time of move in they were clean/services recently. Renteasy claimed they lost these servicing docs but even though it is there fault they dumped charges on us. Second thing beware that during our stay peak summer months there is acute water shortage in the society (like few hours in morning and few hours in evening water used to be available so we had to store water whenever available and use it) <br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Little issues, please see my experience in previous section and always give each and every item's small details (like dirty or not too) at the time of move in to avoid any such conflicts. <br />

Experience of tenants :  Worst owner ever, he is just old greedy person. Who can take money from you for anything. Just for an instance to clean the glass window of the house he charged 5k thats the level of greedyness. Also he literally used to lock the washroom when it was leaking. Also he removed the window of washroom which left the washroom exposed. He hogged complete deposite and return only 12.5 k out of 1 lac.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes, he returned only 12.5k out of 1 lac. And said he need to clean everything. But we were not staying there from march till aug. And most importantly we got house deep cleaned in January itself<br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  Most of the staying experience was okay, except the repair of any damages which they would take forever to resolve else you have to pay on your own and get it resolved. Also, the owner asks for rent including maintenance and would delay maintenance payment to society.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes, the real pain starts after leaving the house. They have collected the keys saying that they will inspect the house and will refund the amount in a weeks time ( my biggest mistake is to give them the keys). Its been over an year - still i did not get my full refund. They have deducted one month rent including maintenance as painting charges. The rest amount they have given as 10 K after 3 months after regular follow up by visiting their home as they never pick up the phone and then 5 K after 2 month and another 5 K after 4 months. Today when i went to their house, they claim that they have done the full refund and said you did not pay for last month rent and that Geyser has to be replaced ( all this after more than a year now). After heated argument he said this is their business and this is how they are planning to build another house and will not refund the money. They are bad people.<br />

Name of pg/hostel/Apartment:  Oceanus freesia enclave  <br />
Address:  Bellandur<br />
<br />
Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  We rented 2bhk for family (husband wife) in oceanus freesia from a broker (and resident of society) named (mr. Pc agarwal). Broker took all the brokerage and token on the day of booking itself. Owner (ms. Nawandhar) took entire deposit before giving the key. Painting was already done. When asked for maintenance work before shifting (fixing taps, lights, exhausts), broker asked us to ask owner directly and he was least bothered. We have to ask owner again n again for bare minimum things. The lady kept on saying she is busy as she is travelling to US, so we have to visit the flat everyday and got the repairs done. When asked for money related to fixing electricals and taps, she said society plumber took high service charge (150/-) so she will only pay material cost of (700 n 200). Rest service charge (150 n 100) we have to pay. We agreed for that also. One day before move in she got angry on this cost thing and told us that we can look flat somewhere else as she feels its a bitter start. She has so much ego n short tempered. Money wise as well as behavior wise she behaved very bad. Its brokers or owners duty to fix all issues and handover the place in a decent working condition to tenants. It was visible to us that some taps/toilet sinks are not working, still she tried to say it is fine..it is fine. We spent our money to deep clean sofa and bathrooms and she said its our duty to do that before move in. Because of her behavior, society plumber also stopped taking her calls as for 1000-2000 rs stuff also she used to ask him to go to shop to buy repair material for her house and then call her to pay bill directly to shopkeeper. She verified cost of materials on amazon if she can get it cheaper.<br />
 We planned to move in on 16th dec and when she told us on 15th that you can look other options, we cancelled moving in on 15th night. They deducted half months rent. And broker vanished away with our money. Broker was equally responsible for this situation as he dint play his role properly. Not only we lost our money, we wasted our time when we went there so many times to get things cleaned and fixing repairs. And last moment we had to move to our friends place as new tenants came into our old place.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  When lady owner's husband intervened, we got deposit after deducting half months rent.<br />

Experience of tenants :  No Deposit returned<br />
Being all female in flat he use to visit the and forced us to check washroom. (This made us uncomfortable - As 1-2 times we understand for some issues, baithe use to come un announced and directly wanted to check flat and washroom)<br />
He wanted to add a clause in agreement stating he will come to flat anytime he wants as he owns it<br />
He had issues with everyone entering the flat whether it's our friends, actual brother. Sometimes even if the repair person comes, he blames us you guys are calling boys in flat. Even the neighbours are nosy and calls his if anyone entered in our flat.<br />
<br />
He blamed us for using his things which were lying there in his fully furnished property and made us to pay for his Tupperware boxes ( which we used and did not took it -more like rental but with actual price of product)<br />
<br />
Agreement clearly said he will increase 5% renta yearly which we all agreed upon, but once agreement was over he wanted to increase rent 12-13% that too we had bad year with no Salary hikes.<br />
<br />
Falt owner pretended to be Sweet in beginning, later intentionally he did not mention that our agreement tenure is over. Since it was 12 month and took advantage and forced us for 12-13%hike in rent.<br />
We were 5 people sharing 3bhk, when 3 of us told him we will leave the flat and search for new one as the budget does not permit us and he was crossing line with his unplanned visits and questions for every visitor. He started blaming us for stealing things from his flat which we never did and never returned our deposit. When we threatened him to call police he said "go ahead and call police all are my friends here and no one can ha him"<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes . We never received deposit back till date<br />

<br />
Experience type:Bad<br />
Experience of tenants :  Worst. The owner sweet talks but don't be fooled with the aminities he mentions when you avail the flat. The owner has seperate keys to each of the 1bhk apartments in the building and can enter at will when you are not there but he doesn't steal. He will mostly do some denting or painting work &amp; never steal but move your things here and there and cause damages. He says about providing parking for both car and bike but instead he keeps his cars parked there and hence sometimes you can find scratches or even dents in your car due to his drivers rash skills but he won't accept it. Then the parking is mostly occupied with building material from his business. For bikes its way worst. Even though they have security but still the dogs will damage the bike seats of tenants.<br />
<br />
I have vacated since 2months as my work is now completely Remote WFH permanently but still he has not refunded the rest 23k ( 7k deduction for painting and maintainance)<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes, Since vacating 2 months ago, he has not refunded 23k ( 7k deduction for painting and maintainance) from 30k deposit. Refuses to pick up calls and since he is a local constructor and Politician has good hold of police in the area and hence doesn't fear of legal actions as well.<br />

Experience of tenants :  1. While staying there were major electrical tripping and lift issues in the apartment which the owner was told however he didn't pay much heed . Due to electrical surcharge every time I lost one or two appliances such as _ AC and Lamp ,aquaguard.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes . A lot . Recently I cleaned and services the entire house and left .he abused me and my friends and family literally when we asked our deposit. I am a single lady and he made me come 15kms to his place in the night to speak rudely and ruthlessly . Apparently tripping issue is caused by me , However his own electrician repaired the MCB and told him that his apartment has internal wiring issue. When told him he refused to give my deposit full and thus I am going to consumer court for justice.<br />

<br />
Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  House was fine. But all the maintenance work like plumbing, electric were paid by me. Nothing from the owner.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Owner name is sunil vasudev. He owns many flats in the society ganga vertica.<br />
Yes, mental torture. I came to my hometown in march 2020 due to lockdown, paid rent(not even reduced) till feb 2021 even though I was not staying in the flat. I messaged the owner in jan 2021, i will be Vacating the flat by Feb 2021 end. We were not able to find the replacement as all the it companies were shutdown in electronic city, very few people were staying there. First of all, the owner doesn't not used to reply to our messages and calls. With so much of difficulty when he picked my call once, I told the same to the owner that getting a replacement is tough, we have been trying a lot. He said keep finding, he will look into it. I vacated the room in feb end, informed him the same, asked about the deposit refund, he didn't reply to my calls and messages. After a few weeks, i still messaged him, he never replied. Meanwhile i was still looking for the replacement. But due to covid second wave, couldn't found anyone. Months passed, but no response from him. I felt helpless and lost hopes of getting the deposit back. Earlier this year, when a new replacement moved in, he told my existing flatmate that manali left just like that, she didn't give me notice, she didn't find the replacement, so i won't refund anything. Such a greedy and liar person! I had been messaging him since January 2021, but he denied. I didn't get back a penny.<br />
<br />
P.S: If you want your hard earned money back, please don't come to c922, ganga vertica. The owner won't return and he is a greedy man. Also, a big liar.<br />

Experience of tenants :  This landlord is a big thief. He never gave you back your deposited money back. I deposited 80,000 to him and I called him, texted him in front of him for 9 months and he gave me 45,000 out of it. I stayed hardly for 2 months and he deducted 35,000 for painting, one month rent and extra. He is such a thief and lots of people have complaint about him before. He never get you repair things if anything is not working. You have to pay on your own. He don’t even know how to talk &amp; respect his own tenants. Once he was beaten up by the police for his absurd behaviour. <br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  He never pay you deposit back and you have to cry for months to get it back and that also with partial amount. He deduced my 30,000 for no reason. I hardly stayed for 2 months and he charged me for painting and shit. <br />

<br />
Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  This flat is overpriced. Despite having some few age-old furnitures and electronic equipments like geyser, fridge, gas and washing machine, no one would ever agree to pay 30000 for this tiny apartment. This place has no balcony and not for even 1 minute out of 24 hrs in a day you can experience natural light and air. I only was living there due to its location from my office. I also had to deal with very noisy neighbours having adults in the neighbourhoods arguing with loud noises which sometime used to disturb my working hour, also kids constantly making noises on the upper floor and in adjacent building having no one to stop them. <br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes, at the time of giving notice to vacate which was 1 month before, landlord agreed that he will refund complete security deposit 1 day before leaving after deducting last month rent. But on the final day, after some inspection of the flat, we initially mutually agreed upon deducting 6k from deposit for deep cleaning and carpentry work of normal wear and tear which I don't see but he does even after coming in the flat directly after 5 months. But as he knew that my flight is just after 2 day he showed me his true color and said that he won't return me a single penny, and after a heated discussion he challenged me to do whatever I can. <br />
I didn't get into any legal proceeding as I was moving out of Bangalore to Gurgaon. <br />

Experience of tenants :  The owner asked for deposit before agreement was signed. Agreement presented later had very unreasonable clauses so we decided not to continue but she refused to give the sum of 90k back as the agreement wasn't signed. This owner lives in JP nagar and troubles her tenants mentally to get her demands met. Found her replacement tenants  for the next month so she wouldn't face any loss when we leave...still she only returned 38k of deposit without giving any reason for the deductions.There were absolutely no damages in the house. Also she doesn't hesitate to put false accusations and fraud on your name to threaten you for a false police case so that you don't mess with her (this is for young tenants who are new to blr).<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes out of my 95k, returned only 38k and have no explanation or response on the deductions. Stopped replying<br />

He will introduce new charges at the time of final settlement like adding maintenance(not in Rent Agreement). <br />

If you are outside then he will enter in your house and check the property. So no privacy, even I asked him to inform me then he was very rude for that. <br />

Experience type:Bad<br />
Experience of tenants :  Pros:<br />
<br />
No owner interference. Green society. Pet friendly. Proximity to shops and supermarket.<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
<br />
Owner will squeeze every last drop of money deductible from deposit when vacating.<br />
House is situated in a semi-natural environment and hence difficult to maintain cleanliness.<br />
Local maids/cooks are not regular and charge more than city average side per month<br />
Owner refuses to pay for house repairs in-spite of proving that it not tenant's fault. <br />
<br />
The most major fault with this house were electricity issues. Apart from not having power backup, the supply voltage is either too high or low which can either damage your appliances or result in water pump not working.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  When we wrote the agreement it was decided that maximum of 25K would be deducted for repairs. When vacating, apart from lightly ill maintained sinks and washing machine area everything else was fine. Still he deducted the entire amount at first quoting ridiculous prices for various unnecessary repairs. We argued and after a lot of headache brought it down to 16K.<br />
<br />
Very disgusting behavior of owner who happens to be a senior citizen. Please do not ever pick this house if you want peace of mind when vacating.<br />

Name of pg/hostel/Apartment:  Sri Alagu Nachi Apartments  <br />
Address:  315/2-1, 5th Main, 12th Cross, Malleshpalya, CV Raman Nagar, Bengaluru (KA) - 560075<br />
<br />
Experience type:Best<br />
Experience of tenants :  Overall, it was a comfortable experience. Landlord is non interfering, polite and friendly. As long as you pay the rent and electricity bill on time, he has no issues. He lives in the same building and respects his tenants' privacy. No restriction on guests of any sort. No issues with food habits or religion as seen in many other apartments. Responsive to issues as well. In my period of stay, there were water supply problems twice, which he resolved quickly. Took 3 months rent as deposit and cut one month rent as painting and deep cleaning charges (which I was fine with) and adjusted the rest of the amount for two months, during which I paid no rent. There is no clause in his agreement where you have to pay a penalty for leaving the house before the contract ends. I left the house 2 months before the contract ended and was not charged extra. <br />
<br />
Only need to make sure that the house is clean and well maintained, and need to be mindful of other neighbours as well.<br />
<br />
Negatives:<br />
1. Natural lighting: the hall and kitchen are blocked by other buildings, and sometimes you have to keep the hall curtains shut.<br />
2. Mosquitoes: Malleshpalya has a huge mosquito issue, not limited to the house<br />
3. Parking: Enough for only one two wheeler. If you own a car, parking may be difficult.<br />
<br />
Overall, reasonable rents and deposits, good houses worth the amount you pay and a great landlord! Any listing from Alagu Nachi Apartments is a fuss free and a good option. <br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  I had my deposit adjusted by not paying the rent for two months. Was not charged extra by the landlord after he inspected the flat after vacating. Personally, did not face any issues.<br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  The owner lady lives in ground and first floor and rents out the other floors. She is extremely intrusive and uncouth. Yells out at the top her voice for trivial issues like smoking in the balcony, coz the smell goes down to her house apparently. Can't put clothes on top to dry when her family's clothes are there... It's crazy!!! House was given without painting, but cut full one months rent while returning the advance!! When asked, she starts yelling again... Beware, she talks very sweetly initially.. <br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes, explained already<br />

<br />
Experience type:Bad<br />
Experience of tenants :  There was no interference from owner, so it was mostly chill. However, there were two big pain points:<br />
1. Society didn't allow female friends in the same house. This came to light when the fiance of my flatmate was stopped at the gate by guards. Even after repeated explanations, they didn't allow her in the premises even, let alone the house. Poor guy had to drop her off somewhere else. Horrible in these times.<br />
2. Owner didn't return deposit, after repeated calls and messages. We ended up overstaying without rent for a few months to recover the deposit.<br />

Experience of tenants :  The PG facilities were fine but there was so many hidden charges like sanitization expenses &amp; health protection plan and the electricity bill was also double. And at last I did not get my refund they were saying like I did not give the notice period but I have proof that i gave the notice period and i also have a message from there side I have been checked out. So i talked to them but they blocked my number. The worst PG ever.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  I did not get my refund they were saying like I did not give the notice period but I have proof that i gave the notice period and i also have a message from there side I have been checked out. So i talked to them and showed them all the proof So they told me wait 1 week you will get your refund but it's been 2 months and they blocked my number. The worst PG ever.<br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  The house is very spacious and the locality is good and the interiors are done in a tasteful fashion. The wiring was very old and short circuits(minor explosions) were very common. Geysers were also very old. The owner(Dev Singh) was reluctant to fix most of the issues pointed out after a week of joining. He fixed some of the non costly issues like changing the light bulbs. The noise pollution from Varthur Road makes it very hard to sleep during the day or focus on tasks. <br />
After I requested him to break the lock in and allow me to move, he started acting in a very toxic manner and started blaming me for everything. I got to know from the security that the past 4 tenants have not stayed there for longer than 4 months. I understood that this was a pattern - he would put a 6 month lock-in when he knows that nobody would be able to survive for more than 3-4 months and then they'd be forced to vacate and he would have the extra money and also make deductions for no reason and then he would find a tenant immediately thus making more money than what he would get if a tenant stayed there for the longer term. <br />
When I asked him about vacating, and when i demanded to know what the deductions would be when I move out, he started threatening me and got very personal. I got to know that he did this and worse with the tenant after me - emotionally tortured them and also deducted a bomb after 4 months of their stay there. <br />
My experience with owners in Bangalore have been great till now for the past 10 years including my current landlord. This guy(Dev Singh) is truly an exception. <br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  I requested him to allow me to vacate after 3 months of stay. He downright refused and started responding in a toxic manner. I vacated the property after 4 months of stay. The owner said he would make deductions though the house was in a state better than how he handed it over to me(deep cleaned the bathrooms and tile floors at my own expense). I asked him to give me an estimate of what the deductions would be and he refused that downright and mentioned that he would only be able to give me an estimate once I vacated and handed over the key. He wanted to deduct complete painting charges though the walls and surfaces were in mint condition(only 4 months). <br />

Experience of tenants :  House experience was horrible.. kitchen was rusted and stinky.. but starting from the time we started staying we kept buzzing the owner and he kept assuring that these would be fixed very soon.. which never happened. And finally when we thought of Vacating, he gave us estimate of changing the entire kitchen.including the Granite and asked me to pay for the same.. this included kitchen baskets too.. and he did deduct 1.09 lac from my security deposit of 1.5 lac.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yea… owner forced to update the entire kitchen and cabinets…and deducted 1.09 lac..where as i did handover in exactly same condition as he had handed over 3 years back.. <br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  Owner Shailendra Dwivedi is a total fraud and liar. His wife Astha will tell you bullshit reasons on house's pathetic condition while handing over possession. The surrounding flat people especially Gyan, Ram and few special ones will create ruckus in your life and everyone else's continuously. These guys put fake pictures online of an under construction place by taking pics from nearby partially completed apartment in same compound. Tenants are treated like animals with interference at each and every point, stupid decisions by few members in the name of so called society (they don't actually have one and rera cases are ongoing), maintenance amount increased every 4-5 months without any justification or improvements and to top it all stupidity to an extent on light placements, security guy placement, even stp charges. These guys have been fighting with B wing people, amongst themselves, with tenants, with builder....the list goes one. Basically bunch of hooligans with Ram and Gyan being the biggest bullies.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes, even for just 4 months of stay the a**hole owner Shailendra deducted 9K lying about painting charges and I bear the cost of entire house cleaning additionally. No damages or even dents were proven but still lost 9K.<br />

Experience of tenants :  Landlord is a very nice guy, lives in Chennai, no interference at all.

Experience of tenants :  Experience was very good. Especially the owner of the house. He was very responsive with any issues. Most of the expenses that were deducted were all discussed well in advance and nothing extra was cut. Things were very smooth with whatever issue was raised.<br />
He is a nice person in general as well and very friendly. I don't think you can expect any kind of rental decrease(ex: during covid times) or painting charge decrease(when leaving he house), but he stays true to generally whatever is agreed upon on the agreement and repairs. From my experience that itself made me like staying in this house. <br />

Experience of tenants :  Extremely pleasant. Completely not interfering owners. Bachelors, family, couple, they don't care as long as you're a good tenant, pay rent on time, and aren't a nuisance to your neighbours. House was repaired and painted when we moved in. The few little things left we got done on our own and cut from the rent. <br />

Experience of tenants :  Promised fully functional house… nothing was was working, I kept following up for months with owner and the nestaway people to get every this repaired. I called them, raised tickets, spoke to owner even tweeted about it. They were all absconding the property manager and others. The electricity bill wasn’t cleared and was pending for “last 1 year before I moved in. I had to clear all of it because the Bescom disconnected the electricity.<br />
After  6 months of my stay they started pushing me to increase the rent or vacate the flat. I stuck with it… they sent me eviction notice by saying I have not paid my rent which amounts to inr 0/- <br />
They kept bothering me me and pressuring me despite of me paying monthly rent on time (I have all the receipts) <br />
I hired a lawyer and sent them a legal notice and terminated the contract on my own. I’m still living in the house until 15th of May I’m not sure what else to come. Will see and update more about the my exit!<br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  Owner is very rude. Will interfere every now then. We were 6 friends (male) living there..You can not even bring your male flatmates on your wish, as per owner you have to seek his permission for that. He will be very polite in the beginning till we do agreement. Owner will directly enter the house to show the flat without even asking you. Every now and then will ask to keep the flat "clean" as per his views and so on<br />
<br />
Worst time will be when you decide to leave the flat. He will keep coming to inspect the flat frequently and will not tell what is the reason.<br />
Many of the things which were used for many years, he will charge for those for brand new one. For instance- Only switch of fan was not working, he charged for brand new fan.<br />
He charged 4k for cleaning flat, when we offered to clean flat by ourself or through other person to whom we will the charges, he refused..<br />
So many things, he is very rude.. PLEASE AVOID THE FLAT.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  He deducted 20k excluding painting charges (24k)<br />

Experience of tenants :  It was a really good experience. The house was initially occupied by the owners themselves, and when I moved in, the room was renovated. The rent and deposit were at fair price. Proper documentation of lease, etc. was done. Some of the specific things liked during my stay were:<br />
<br />
1. The condition of the house and the furnishing provided<br />
2. The rent and deposit being fair<br />
3. The location (since it was close to my office at Manyata Tech Park) - Although this point can be debatable based on each individual's needs<br />
4. The owners - They were very warm and welcoming when I first visited the house for finalizing. They also had no issues with guests coming over to the property. They also shared some tips on moving around since this was my first time in the city<br />
<br />
Overall, would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a place in Banaswadi. 🙂 <br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  None at all!<br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  UPDATE: We got the money back after much haggling<br />
Flat no S7-102<br />
Greenwood Regency (Sarjapur Road, near Byg Brewski)<br />
Please avoid this flat at all costs if you want to stay away from lying and extorting owners.<br />
We took the flat last year in fully furnished condition and reasonable rent due to covid. House was in a poorly maintained conditioned with faulty geyser, old fridge, torn off sofa, random holes in the wall with wires coming out, leaky cisterns, broken curtain rods, dirty kitchen with cockroach infestation and so on. <br />
We had to fight tooth and nail with the owner to get the initial repairs and deep cleaning done, to make the house habitable at least.<br />
Showered with cold water for weeks due to owner's indifference about non-functional geyser which had exploded in front of me. <br />
We managed without a working fridge for days again due to owner's delay and misery about 100-200 rupees. <br />
In fact, some of the smaller fixings (upto 2k) we did by ourselves just to avoid stressful fights with them. <br />
Two weeks before we moved out, owner visited and inspected the house twice, when we mentioned about poor cooling in fridge and broken/torn furnishings. They saw, said sorry and discussed the security amount to be returned. Also forced us to pay for the deep cleaning for next tenant. Owner even said (with 5 people witness) that we have maintained the house in a great way and much better than his previous tenants.<br />
Now after we moved out, owner is refusing to pay back 10k of the deposit, saying you damaged the fridge and sofa. We are unable to argue as the couple is clearly lying shamelessly.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes, we had to haggle for refund as owner refused to pay back 10k of the deposit, saying you damaged the fridge and sofa, which are complete lies. <br />

Experience of tenants :  This old guys came to talk to is with full attitude said 27k is the rent but we won't give you any pan or anything basically we cannot show any proof of investment. But the bad phase started when COVID began and we wanted to vacate the house he said instead 1 month rent we will deduct 4 months rent because our house will be empty even after we served 3 months of notice. They were not ready to let my things go out only until I paid the full amont.<br />

Experience type:Bad<br />
Experience of tenants :  The landlady is very sweet during the time of rent agreement signing. However, after a year, she started misbehaving by switching off the elevator in her own whims and moods. She does not get the common areas of the property cleaned despite staying in the same building. She owns the 3-story building but no care whatsoever.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Biggest red flag - she denied to return my the deposit amount despite us having stayed there for two years and giving her a headsup about us vacating the place when I lease was ending. Her reason? She does not have the money to give!<br />
It was after a lot of coaxing and patience that she agreed to issue a 4-month post-dated cheque. Thankfully, it did not bounce but the whole hassle was a nightmare.<br />

One lady in the same house had to call police to settle down the payment during exit.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Got an idea about his nature. So told him well ahead of time I will leave the flat in 2 months and didn't payed the rent. But he asked to leave the house in 1 month <br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  The landlord keeps visiting house without prior notice. Just one week after the agreement was signed, he messaged me saying that he has to sell the house. People keep visiting for house inspection, without prior information. My landlord knows that i am single and it's a matter of security, but he doesn't listen and says...only one month notice, i have to give you. My neighbours told me, he did the same with previous tenants even before covid. Now without informing me..he has put the house for rent advertisement on various sites and apps. Again people have started visiting without prior information. I have requested him to be respectful and honest in sharing such things, but he doesn't pay heed to my constant requests. <br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  He said he will deduct one month rent for painting, even if he asks me to vacate before the house, if he gets new tenants.<br />

Experience of tenants :  The Owner of the house Mr RajaSekhar Reddy is a leech. The interaction with the owner hadn't been pleasant from the day one, but we anyway went ahead with the deal, thinking that once we rent the flat there wouldn't be much of talking to and we'll be fine. But we didn't knew what we were getting ourself into. Anyone who is taking the flat in the building, please think twice<br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  Experience in the house was not bad. I paid the rent and the bills on time and i felt the manager wont be a dick as he turned out to be<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  The rental agreement said 6 months of stay and 25000 deposit with half month rent deducted (7500 rent). I moved out on june 5th 2022. That month’s rent was to be adjusted in the deposit. I had to get 13750. I asked the manager to come and check the flat before i was leaving so that later he cannot point out anything. He didnt come. He sent the guard. He checked everything and everything was fine. When i boarded my train he texted me that geyser is not working (i took a bath with warm water the day i submitted the flat) and 2k repair charges (i asked him for the bill he said local people dont give bill) and 1k cleaning charges when the flat was not even dirty. I requested him a lot but he didnt agree cus i didnt follow just one rule of the agreement which was i cannot bring people over and my friend used to come. Which the manager knew but didnt say anything about it until the day i left the flat to take the leverage of the situation. I agreed to his deductions finally and i had to get 10078. Now he is saying that i need to alter the original agreement and write on it that “the deposit is settled” and sign on it and then only he will give the deposit. Agreeing that i got the deposit before getting the deposit was not acceptable and he was not agreeing otherwise even though i was saying i will alter the agreement once he sends the deposit. He harrassed me so much for the deposit that was mine. The money was mine. I have financial issues and i am helpless with the loss of the deposit. 10k is a huge sum for me. I know he wont give the deposit even after i alter the agreement and if i do so i wont even have a proof that i was right.<br />

Experience of tenants :  Inverter was faulty. Also gyser was not working properly. Owner told us will give new inverter but sushila the care taker told us he gave you the old one. While leaving her husband shouted on us telling you guys damaged inverter and gyser. We did complain and fix gyser multiple times and the electrician who came was called by owner and care takers. Electrician told us gyser has leakage and it's faulty I am giving a temporary fix. Finally we took the decision to leave the apartment. While leaving we were ready to pay painting charges but they deducted gyser and inverter charges too. Such a pathetic people. We left our bulbs also thinking they will return. We called for our remaining deposits at that time she told owner has told us deduct and they will not talk and if you will ask number and call him they will charge more. Also for 20 days she bluffed that owner is in hospital so he cannot return deposit as of now. What a greedy people<br />

I told to care taker before moving in when i saw cockroaches she told me she will take care. Nothing was done even cupboard drawers were tight and shower was not working. After we moved in we followed for 20 days to fix it. Her husband Ganesh is pathetic.<br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  Worst owner who gave the agreement and no value for 11 months agreement. It's been just 5 months after that he doubled the rent. The broker who showed the house is Prasad S. He is permanent broker to that owner and owner has 3 building of flats in that area. I have the agreement copy with me as well.<br />
They both owner and broker plan and get people only for few months and make rent double, so that both broker and owner is making huge amount of money out of it in the name of house paint, cleaning and brokerage. No value for agreement. Such a worst experience staying there.<br />
I suggest not to go to his flats. Boycott YSR recidency. Owner name is Sandeep Reddy. His broker is Prasad S.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes. He deducted paint charges and cleaning charges separately . Who will deduct double the amount for 5months of stay?<br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  Owner is money minded. They talked very nicely until they received security money. After that they didn’t give proper response.<br />
A number of times, I faced Wall damping (because of water leakage in above flat's bathrooms) problems in both bathrooms, kitchen and one of the balconies. They took a minimum of 1-2 month to get it fixed. In fact there was a leakage in the toilet water pipe coming down from above bathroom in one of the balconies. It took 4 months to fix it and that also when I warned that I will vacant the flat.<br />
<br />
I paid 5 months rent (1 lac) as security deposit. Although notice period was 2 months, I informed 3 months before and even after informing each progress on vacating the owner didn’t turn up at the last day. He made me wait for 3 hours to do the settlement and that also happened on call only. They deduced extra 12k other than one month rent (painting charge as per the rental agreement). <br />
As per them, this extra 12k is for both the bathroom’s tap change (8k) + exhaust fan change (2k) + miscellaneous minor repairs (2k). <br />
When I took flat, there was already issue with taps in both the bathrooms. Taps were old and so hard to turn. Even exhaust fan had some issue. When asked they told it will be fixed before I will shift. But, they never fixed it.<br />
<br />
Another major problem was there is no power backup. When I asked caretaker at the time of taking the flat, he told me that rarely power cut happens and power back up won’t be a problem. My mistake I trusted that cunning guy.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Details in the experience above.<br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  Although it's a new building there were wall damp issues with started around December 2021 and it continue to get worse. I then contracted the owner to fix is problem and they just put an overall white cement fixture and no water sealant because the wall started crumbling 1 month after the issue started. The owner kept delaying for months because of minor rain and now with Bangalore's red alert which started in August, the situation is so bad that water is seeping in the house and now there's a mild issue. Since we had a heated discussion about this, he has asked me to leave the flat as the fixture will take 2-3 months of repair (which is a lie) but mostly because my agreement is ending in August 2022 and now he wants to rent control this apartment. The price of the other apartments have also increased.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  I am yet to receive the deposit. Will receive end of August<br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  Worst case experience from the owner &amp; his son and daughter in law! 1st they behave like family after the few months they have family issues like Partition. One day the son and wife come ask the rent , i was told them as per my agreement the rent transfer to the owner account. But they denied, after the few days the act like ****. Last time i was delayed rent because of the medical issues. The owner agreed there is no pblm. I was paid that rent same month ending. The son every month call me for rent! Last time i told him if you owed this house please change agreement then i will transfer the money otherwise I don’t have any options. That day he trow cement bricks on my bike. The owner came to apologise for his son. Finally the Vacating time the owner and son played nicely coz 50k my deposit 5k for deductions for painting. They cut the 16.5k for rent + 16.5k for painting. Please careful these people don’t trust them! First the act like family slowly they will utilise.<br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  Owner used to be irritating in general- barging in the house whenever he felt like it, calling 5 times a day, everyday. But, we put up with it anyway because he is an aged person.<br />
<br />
One day, he said he won't allow our maid into the building. When I asked why, he sent us notice to vacate for no reason.<br />
<br />
Upon asking the maid, I found out that he wanted her to work for him for free as a service charge for letting her come within the premises.<br />
<br />
The building has 4 floors. Owner stays in the ground floor, 1st floor was vacant, and the maid worked for the two families renting on 2nd and 3rd floors.<br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  Owner deducted money randomly from our deposits without giving any details. I got locked in washroom once because the door got jammed (since the door locks were not changed since more than 11years) and while vacating she deducted lock charges also from my deposit stating that because of you we had to break the lock but the fact is I was locked inside for 25min and owner was reluctant to break the lock. Her husband was trying to open it with old debit card. As if i wantedly locked myself in she was blaming me and deducted my money along with some random charges which she did not even bother to tell me.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes. I had to fight with her to get my deposit back on time. Same was the case with previous tenants.<br />

Experience of tenants :  Not good experience. <br />
It's nice place to stay. Cleanliness is well maintained. Flats are small but enough for a family of 2. <br />
Owner won't allow you to use lift for refrigerator though it weighs just 45 kg. Staircase is also very narrow. Refrigerator may get damaged. <br />
Same is case for other household things such as sofas etc. though they are under 50 kg. <br />
My flat was not painted when I shifted here, still owner took full painting charges and on top of that he took extra cleaning charges though I maintained the flat well.<br />
Please discuss these things before hand only. Otherwise you will get in trouble.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Though the house is not painted when I shifted there, still full painting charge was deducted. On top of that, extra cleaning charges were taken.<br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  One of the worst experience.<br />
Initially was told 14k+ 2k maintenance.<br />
Once I moved in to the house. <br />
So many faults water doesn't come properly in pipes, sink was having a crack, water leakage in kitchen sink, rain water comes inside through the bottom of floor..<br />
When we informed owner they simply said once occupied its tenants responsibility to fix it <br />
<br />
Now comes the maintenance. You have to pay 2k which is standard maintenance cost (for security person &amp; lift + cleaning (lift doesn't have backup also)<br />
We were never told water is chargeable. Per litre of water for 1.1 rupees<br />
They had a borewell water and water meter was installed for each house. The septic tank concept was poor.<br />
Rain water goes into septic tank and it gets filled. Now the maintenance guys come and say pit cleaning is happening 2 to 3 times a week so we will be sharing pit cleaning charges seperately.<br />
<br />
So 2k standard amount+ 2.5k for water (if minimally used) + 2k around for pit cleaning.<br />
I need to spend almost half the rent for maintenance.<br />
Poor thing is not even lights are working in corridor.<br />
<br />
Owner simply says whoever is staying there should talk to maintenance guys for these concerns.<br />
Maintenance guys say ur owner is not saying anything y u guys are creating a fuss<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yeah we had to go behind them for the refund<br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  one of the worst experiences, initially said car parking is available and once shifted after that he said no car parking very rudely. once we were late by 2 days for paying rent he just abrutly said that get out of my house and then finally after 5 months when i complained about dog doing potty every night near our doorstep, that time owner just said get out within next month. The worst worst worst ever. Always stayed with good owners but such owner has just taken the enthusiasm of mine staying in bangalore<br />

Experience type:Bad<br />
Experience of tenants :  After 1 year of completion of lease, opener verbally increased rent and did not give a new lease. On asking for it repeatedly, after 2 months he asked me to vacate saying his sister wants to move into the city. It was abrupt and out of nowhere. I somehow found a place and vacated the house. Post moving out, I visited the society and saw 2 guys living in the house instead. <br />
<br />
This was during the insane rise in rentals in Bangalore. He never even tried negotiating with us, just threw us out<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes, he unnecessarily cut 15k from my deposit and didn’t even whitewash the place<br />

Experience type:Bad<br />
Experience of tenants :  If you care about your sanity, please stay away from this place. Lots of issues. Let me list few of them here :<br />
1. Appartment is horrible and so are the people. The noise is easily transferred from the top and the side flats. Forget your sleep. The neighbour who is causing the trouble acts like an animal and has no empathy towards you.<br />
2. The owner is equally money minded piece of tool. Has no civic sense on how to talk. Uses rubbish language. <br />
3. At the time of exit, they will charge whatever they please as painting charge. I was okay with paying 1 month rent as painting charge however these greedy vultures will demand more. The entire owner family is crooked and uses all means to deduct money from you, especially the older lady. <br />
They will sweet talk at the beginning but please don't be a fool like me. Don't go by their words and best to stay away from this place. you will lose your sanity during your stay and at the time of exit, the owner will leech in.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes. They demand whatever they please as painting or maintenance charger.<br />
They charge here is more then the 1 month rent which is already high enough.<br />
Horrible money minded people and lack all the sense of civilized conversation.<br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  The owner asked for rent increment the very next month of renting this place. When we said as per agreement the rent stays same for next 10 more months, he started creating problems for us on a daily basis, from random house visits to useless enquiries. Now, even before agreement time is over, he told us to vacate the house in the middle of the month. We come to the point where we asked him what will be new rent if we want to stay on, then he said he now wants Rs. 28,000 per month and more security deposit. We rented this place for Rs. 17,000 per month and Rs. 50,000 security deposit.<br />
We moved out because the house was not worth spending Rs. 28,000 in rent. Further, is not returning the deposit and denying that he even have any saying all will be used in repairing and painting. I suggest everyone to stay away from this crook.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  He denied returning any deposit amount saying he has commitments and he cannot pay me back and that I can do nothing to make him pay.<br />

Experience type:Worst<br />
Experience of tenants :  House is ok and during raining season it's very difficult as the entire corridor get full of rain water. The Major issue is with the Owner as he keeps changing his words and doesn't keep his words. During leaving the house he makes unnecessary deduction of the tenants for no reason<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes i had vacated the house by Nov. End and hand over the key by 2nd Dec. 2022. I had gave the house in a very clean condition but the owner has deducted Dec. Month rent too. I kept him informing everything until he didn't said anything then after 15 days follow up he called at this house started asking for Dec. Month rent then he charged then he deducted Rs. 500 for tubelight wherein it got damaged within 2 months after taking the house i had informed the same to owner, that point of time he said it's fine will look into it. Now while leaving he turned it against to me then he started saying after 11 months i the rent was increased so that arrear amount also i need to pay. By all possible ways he was trying to make more deduction and trying to not to pay our deposit amount. Still i had to bear loss a little and then got rest amount<br />

Experience type:Bad<br />
Experience of tenants :  Rent increased from 11.7k to 21.6k with 2 days notice. Creating further problems while wanting to move out (charging entire month's rent when I stayed for only 1 day in the month in that place). Lot of noise in the recent times due to unruly tenants. Very unclean place with cockroaches all around. Customer care is practically nonexistent due to their lack of experience in providing help.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes, they are quoting full month's rent for 1 day stay in the place as my move-out date falls on 1st Feb 2023. My deposit is 12k, but the rent being quoted is 21.6k<br />

Experience of tenants :  House owner entered the house on multiple occasions, when I was not at home without informing me. He sited reasons like puja, taking window measurements etc. When I asked him why he entered and that he should have informed me before, he got really angry and started verbally abusing me and asking me to get out at that instant. He was furious as to why he has to take my permission to enter his house. He doesn’t even understand the concept of privacy. He behaves this way to everyone around and his reaction was not a surprise. It is quite common to see him shouting at the front gate at workers or vendors or neighbors. Please avoid this owner Muniraju at all costs!!<br />

Experience of tenants :  Experience in the property was good, it is a good society.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  We were dealt with an agent managing the property as the owner is in Dubai. No issues until we vacated, I vacated on 14th May. Today it is 8th June till now he has not returned the Advance amount 1.75L. The agent said the owner will refund the amount, he is informed etc., but as there was no sign of him repaying I messaged him directly in whatsapp. That is when he asked for NOC from association. I got in touch with the association but they are not aware of any NOC process and unsure what the owner exactly is asking for. After having convinced association finance team to provide an email confirmation on no payment due. I reverted to the agent and the owner but no response. <br />
No acknowledgement of receiving my messages. He is online in whatsapp but haven't responded even my calls to his UAE number is not answered.<br />
<br />
I am going through mental agony. Don't know how to proceed further. Agent is promising that owner would refund the amount in two days but I lost hope.<br />

Experience of tenants :  Owner is the most selfish. She is one of those kinds who speak sweetly before you rent. Her entire family visits the house suddenly for inspection which is okay but pin points even the slightest marks in the bathroom and accuses you for not being clean. Asks for pictures of the house every now and then on whatsap. She also comes up with excuses for deducting money from the deposit. Very selfish lady. On the last month of my stay she asked me to sleep on the couch so that the next “potential” renter can have the bed. Obviously i said no. But you get the idea of what kind of a person she would be to even ask me that when I had already paid full months rent. <br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Deducts one month rent if you don’t find your replacement <br />

Experience type:Bad<br />
Experience of tenants :  Worst Flat in the area. The flat has hardly any air and sunlight. Windows in room are very small. The back of building has Company AC running which won’t allow you to open windows. Too loud from 9am to 8pm. You cannot stay in bedroom in weekdays. Owner is only concerned about money and her flat. No pets/plants/drills etc allowed even for water purier. <br />
<br />
Also the maintenance is taken in cash so you can’t claim hra. Overall rent is 30k + 10k in cash.<br />
Any issue regarding deposit refund:  Yes, owner is greedy.<br />

Experience of tenants :  Owner is greedy and fraud. There was few pending works in the flat he promised to complete before we moved in. But it's been 2 months, there is no response.

However, still deducted more than a month's rent.<br />
